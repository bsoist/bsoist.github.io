## Websites

### Don't Just Believe
[My latest project][djb] and the one I care the most about now should launch sometime in 2018.

### Token Filings
A [project][tf] a partner and I launched to test the market for information about token filings. We insisted it was not an "Edgar for Tokens" but that's the way at least [one person saw it][fwtf].

### Token Summit
[Token Summit][ts] is a website I help maintain for an event organized by a friend and business partner.

### Startup Management
[Startup Management][sum] is a website I helped create for curating news and information about startups.

### Teaching News Network
[Teaching News Network][tnn] is a copy of StartupManagement I set up for curating information that might be of interest to educators.

### KnoxVoice
A custom built Django powered website to serve as the new online home of [Knoxville Voice][kvw], the only major, general-interest independent alternative newspaper in Knoxville, TN until it ceased publication in 2009 ([Knoxvoice.com at archive.org][kv]).

### Stop The Memes!
A [site][stm] I set up after fuming over a few Facebook posts during the 2016 election season in the U.S.

### ManBabyPOTUS
[A fun little project][mbp] I decided to build to keep track of the mayhem.

### Get Mets Tickets
I had what I thought was a [brilliant idea][gmt] to give away tickets to New York Mets baseball games. It was mildly successful and drew some attention from the NY media.

### PayLoadz
A custom built mySQL/PHP powered [website][pl], which allowed sellers to post and sell digital content. Orders were processed and digital products were delivered automatically using PayPal APIs.

### Sky Sports
A custom built mySQL/PHP powered website - [Sports.co.uk][sky] - which aggregated sports information from syndicated content.

### Really Check Yourself
A Google Maps powered tool I built for integration into an existing website - [ReallyCheckYourself.com][rcy].

### All Barcode Systems and Coe90
The owner of two existing e-commerce sites - [allbarcodesystems.com][bar] and [coe90.com][coe] - was growing tired of manually processing orders placed on his websites, I added funchionality for orders to be automatically placed and processed.

### Free Sound Effects and Music Loops
I wrote some code to solve a difficult sorting problem for [MusicLoops.com][loops] and [FreeSoundEffects.com][eff]. 

### Self Investors
I wrote several custom WordPress plugins for [SelfInvestors.com][si].
