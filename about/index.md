## About Me
My name is Bill. I am a programmer, educator, and trouble maker.

## Contact Me
I am naturally curious. Feel free to contact me about my work or anything I post online. Find me on Medium ( [@bsoist][https://blog.bsoi.st/] ) or Twitter ( [@boisst][https://twitter.com/bsoist] ) or call/text me at 302.287.6178.

## About www.bsoi.st
This place used to be where I posted my thoughts on faith, family, freedom, and fun; or wrote about what I read, listen to, and watch.

I do that [over here][https://blog.bsoi.st/] now, but I still share [links here][/links/].
