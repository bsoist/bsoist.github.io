Thanks for signing up for free email updates from my blog!

You need to do one more thing before you&#8217;ll start receiving the updates.

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Check your email for a message from <strong>feedblitz@mail.feedblitz.com.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the link in that email.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don’t see the email in about 10 minutes, check your spam filter.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may want to add <strong>feedblitz@mail.feedblitz.com</strong> to your contacts or list of “safe senders” in your email program. Otherwise, the information you requested might end up in a nasty spam filter.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Once you do that, I’ll forward you the information you requested.
