    <li>
      Check your email for a message from <strong>feedblitz@mail.feedblitz.com.</strong>
    </li>

      Click the link in that email.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you donât see the email in about 10 minutes, check your spam filter.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may want to addÂ <strong>feedblitz@mail.feedblitz.com</strong> to your contacts or list of âsafe sendersâÂ in your email program. Otherwise, the information you requested might end up in a nasty spam filter.
    </li>
  </ol>
