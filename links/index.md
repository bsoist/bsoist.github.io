I've obsessed about how I share links for a long time.

I'm finally settled on a system I built that [works for me][1]. When I get some time to do it, I'll display the links here, but for now, you can find the [RSS feed over here][2]. 

I used [Radio3][3] for a short while.

Before that I used [delicious][4].
