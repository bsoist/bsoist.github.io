You may have arrived here following a link from a bad review. 

I see a lot of films in the theater at this point because [my son gave me a short term Movie Pass subscription for Fathers Day][1]. Since I see a lot of films, I end up seeing a lot of bad films. It&#8217;s that simple.

I plan to review my Movie Pass experience after my 90 day subscription is over. When I do, I&#8217;ll post a link here. Until then, you can learn a bit about it, by following the link in the paragraph above.
