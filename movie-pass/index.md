You may have arrived here following a link from a bad review.

I see a lot of films in the theater at this point because [my son gave me a short term Movie Pass subscription for Fathers Day][1]. Since I see a lot of films, I end up seeing a lot of bad films. It&#8217;s that simple.

I didn't end up seeing as many movies as I'd planned, but having the pass was a lot of fun. I'm planning to buy one for each of us just before the summer of 2015.
