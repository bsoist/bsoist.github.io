More than six months ago, I told C. C. Chapman that a post of his inspired, and I quote, “my next post.”

Though I fully intended to make that my next post, I didn’t get around to it until today. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

When I read his post, &#8211; [Beliefs][1] &#8211; I was spending most of my time thinking about the very same things. I was working through some changes in my own life, dealing with the constant rhetoric of a U.S. Presidential election, and working on a personal project I’ve been talking about for decades. It was just not the right time to write about it.

> I just think it’s better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier. People die for it, people kill for it.

That’s how I see it. I’ve always been believed a certain way about certain things, but I’ve also been open to new ideas. The only thing I’m absolutely sure of is that I could be wrong.

> to each his own

Well, maybe. I understand the context in which this was written, and I agree with that, but there is also an appropriate time to call someone out for believing in &#8211; and especially in spreading &#8211; bull.

I am not interested in being the belief police, but don’t try to sell your nonsense to me. Believe what you want, but I am not going to pretend it makes sense when it doesn’t.

Reminds me of this … ( 1:50 &#8211; 2:35 if you’r short on time )
