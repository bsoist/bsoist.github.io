On July 13 we began our Harry Potter movie marathon in preparation for the newest film. We&#8217;d all seen the films before but we wanted to enjoy them again. Billy went to see the new on for the midnight opening but the rest of us just got a chance to see it a few days ago.

Watching the films reminded me again of how wonderful the books are. I&#8217;ve read *Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone* several times and it never fails for me. It is simply a wonderful read. The story is quite predictable in a lot of ways and the characters are not particularly complex, but I was mesmerized by it the first time and it is just as much fun to read every time.

If you are one of the few who has not read the books you should do yourself a favor and check them out. The films are excellent but the books are even better.
