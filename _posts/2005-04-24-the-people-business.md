This Sunday&#8217;s message was about &#8220;the people business.&#8221; Pastor shared with us that most people leave a church for some reason related to social interactions in the church. The simple fact is that if people don&#8217;t like the people in a church, they leave. As the message began I was very uncomfortable. I have been in church my whole life. Dad and Mom were both very active in ministry and the administration of our church. When I was seventeen we moved to a new church. I fell in love with the pastor&#8217;s daughter and we were married when I was twenty-two. As a result of my background I have a different perspective on church. I&#8217;d like to think I wouldn&#8217;t leave a church because of the people. To me church is much more than just the people. As the message progressed I began to see how this message related to our message from last week about making disciples. Many people do not know what they really need, but they know what they want. They come to church looking for it. If we give them what they are looking for (without crossing certain boundaries, of course) we will have the opportunity to give them what they need.
