I&#8217;m planning a trip to Italy. While I am there, I may fly back for the Mets homeÂ openerÂ - seriously &#8211; so I tried to search for GMT to get the flight times straight.

Google warned me about every result. I was very annoyed by two things. One, I use a Mac so most of these warnings don&#8217;t apply (I KNOW some do), and 2) the only way to continue to the site is to copy and past the URL (or type it) and go.

Then I noticed that even the Wikipedia entry was flagged. What?

Then I decided to search to see if my websites were flagged &#8211; Yep! Even my twitter page, hmmm? So, I searched for Twitter &#8211; Yep.Â 

What about YouTube, a Google property. Searched for youtube and sure enough the first result was www.youtube.com which was flagged.Â 

So, I sent a tweet to ask for help. Seems that about 300 people sent tweets just minutes before.Â 

Good news &#8211; the problem seems to be fixed.
