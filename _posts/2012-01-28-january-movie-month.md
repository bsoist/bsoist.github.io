While Billy was home for Christmas break we watched a lot of movies. We watched a few I had already seen ([over here][1]), but we also saw quite a few that I had not seen yet. As always, I&#8217;ve listed them pretty much in the order I enjoyed them.

## The Best

> I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.

Jonah Hill has been great in every role I&#8217;ve seen him play. If you&#8217;ve read my other movie posts, you probably know that I also think Brad Pitt is fantastic. You may have also gathered that I&#8217;m a huge fan of baseball.

For me, another quote from the movie sums it all up &#8211; How can you not get romantic about baseball?

Billy and I enjoy Samurai movies. This one was fantastic. We also enjoy just as much how much difficulty we have keeping up with the characters, and how much effort we put into doing a better job keeping up. We also enjoy discussing how silly the hair is and how similar all these movies are.

> Like flying to the moon is possible, but it&#8217;s never going to happen&#8230; 

A quirky fun movie with an inspirational story that was, in my opinion, not too hokey.

> He who seeks beauty will find it. 

I thoroughly enjoy documentaries about interesting people obsessed with things for which I have no interest. This was no exception.

### *  
Alphaville

<div style="float:right;padding:10px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WAM0ZO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B002WAM0ZO"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ASIN=B002WAM0ZO&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B002WAM0ZO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
</div>

> I&#8217;m fine, thanks. Don&#8217;t mention it. 

I enjoy science fiction, I enjoy noir, I enjoy secret agents, and I like black and white. So, I enjoyed this film even though I had no idea what was going on. 

## The Worst

### *  
Before the Devil Knows You&#8217;re Dead  
*

<div style="float:right;padding:10px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019KBHKM/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0019KBHKM"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ASIN=B0019KBHKM&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0019KBHKM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
</div>

> Sorry ain&#8217;t going to pay the bills, chico. 

I think Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant and I absolutely love Marisa Tomei. There performances are the only thing that saved this movie for me. I love this kind of surprising plot, but perhaps I didn&#8217;t enjoy this film as much as I should have because it didn&#8217;t quite live up to the standard of Fargo. 

### *  
Never Let Me Go  
*

<div style="float:right;padding:10px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LQI0HE/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B004LQI0HE"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ASIN=B004LQI0HE&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B004LQI0HE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
</div>

> You have to know who you are, and what you are. It&#8217;s the only way to lead decent lives. 

The most disappointing film on this list for me. I was really looking forward to it. Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield were fantastic (as usual), but they didn&#8217;t have much to work with.

### *  
The Road  
*

<div style="float:right;padding:10px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IWRE3I/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B003IWRE3I"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&#038;Format=_SL110_&#038;ASIN=B003IWRE3I&#038;MarketPlace=US&#038;ID=AsinImage&#038;WS=1&#038;tag=weifyoasme-20&#038;ServiceVersion=20070822" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B003IWRE3I" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

> If he is not the word of God, then God never spoke. 

I&#8217;m a big fan of films that explore what happens to us under the worst of circumstances. I was hoping for more from this film when I saw the trailer for the first time, and this would also have been a huge disappointment if I hadn&#8217;t already gotten wind of how bad it was. For me, it was better than expected, but it could have been much better.

> Oh spare me the Oliver Twist routine, Charlie love. You need to build your audience. 

Hardy is fantastic, but aside from the time I got to spend with my son (watching and discussing it after) it was a waste of time.

> Yep, this is my plan. 

I think Kidman and Clooney are both fantastic &#8211; in other films! Best way to sum this one up is another quote from the film &#8211; &#8220;Well, this is meaningless.&#8221; Exactly!
