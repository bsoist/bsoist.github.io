I&#8217;ve decided the next project I back is a documentary film entitled ***[Solar Dreams][1]***. From the project page &#8230;

> ***Solar Dreams*** explores the political, economic, and social barriers to the proliferation of solar energy production through the eyes of two young men who believe that the world could be a better place. Neither very automotive savvy, they convert an old VW bus into a solar electric vehicle. Traveling the country the interview politicians, scientists, energy system designers, and other solar dreamers. Following the path set forward by Hermann Scheer in his book The Solar Economy.

I really intended to avoid funding films until I hit every other group (since I&#8217;ve already funded one and my tendency would be to fund mostly films), but I thought this was an interesting project. 

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
