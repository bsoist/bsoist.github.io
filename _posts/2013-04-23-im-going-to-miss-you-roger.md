I didn&#8217;t have a chance to post my thoughts on the passing of Roger Ebert. I know it&#8217;s old news now, but I must make note of his impact on my life.

I&#8217;ve always been a film nut. I love good films &#8211; the &#8220;arty&#8221; films, intelligent films, etc. &#8211; and I love a good &#8220;popcorn flick&#8221; once in a while too. I just love films of every kind.

I never cared much for film critics, but I always enjoyed watching Ebert&#8217;s show. I learned early on that his reviews were often filled with spoilers, but I still watched.

When he began sharing reviews online, that was a big thing for me personally. After watching a film, one of the first things I would do was visit his review. Typically, I would visit IMDB to figure out who the heck all those people I recognized were, then I&#8217;d visit Ebert&#8217;s review.

I&#8217;m going to miss that, and I will very much appreciate watching older films more than ever because I&#8217;ll get to do that some more.

In the days just past his passing, many links were shared, these were my favorites.
