My [12 in 12 goal][1] for January was to stick to a morning reading routine, and I didn&#8217;t miss a day all month. I did drop the ball on the first day of February, but I have been back on track every day since.

My goal for February didn&#8217;t work out as well. As a family, we were all sticking to a diet faithfully until the holidays. I thought getting back on track with that would be a good goal for February. We did okay, but didn&#8217;t really stick to it every day. We plan to get back on track again in March.

I have a plan for March that I am excited about. Once again, I&#8217;m not talking about it until the end of the month, but I am looking forward to this one a great deal. And I do plan to stick with both the diet and the morning routine.
