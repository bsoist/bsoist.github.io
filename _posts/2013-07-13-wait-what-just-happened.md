Disappointing in the extreme!

Too much senseless CGI action violence. Too much 9/11 imagery. One scene, in particular, made me sick. Too much jumping around. At one point I leaned to ask Terri &#8220;wait, how did they get outside?&#8221; Too much Messiah/savior imagery. Too much of everything, actually.

Costner, Shannon, and Lane were great. Crowe&#8217;s perfomance was solid, but I have a hard time judging him objectively. I just don&#8217;t like the guy. I will restate my [oft-expressed][1] [opinion][2] that it&#8217;s a brilliant move to cast the adorable Amy Adams in any role where you need the audience to understand falling in love with her. Unfotunately, in this film, she turned in what might have been the worst performance of her career.
