Since I&#8217;ve neglected my blog for so long, I have a list of books queued up that I&#8217;d like to review. I will certainly review some of these in the weeks.

## What the Dog Saw {#what_the_dog_saw}

Were it not for [this project][1], I may not have chosen to read this or the next two books. This was a [fascinating read][2]. It explores what Publishers Weekly calls &#8220;the hidden extraordinary.&#8221;

## Outliers {#outliers}

While [this book][3] falls flat at the end (in my opinion), it was one of my favorite books of the year. I find myself referring to information from it all the time in conversation. I highly recommend it.

## Have a Little Faith {#have_a_little_faith}

I&#8217;ve [already reviewed][4] this but I couldn&#8217;t put this list up without making note of it. It was much better than I expected out of this kind of book. An easy read &#8211; very well worth your time.

## Open {#open}

An [enlightening and terrifying look][5] into the life of Andre Agassi. I always liked this guy and now I have some idea why.

## Stones Into Schools {#stones_into_schools}

A continuation of the story of [*Three Cups of Tea*][6] by the same author. Read that first and then read [this book][7]. The author&#8217;s commitment to do something important no matter what the consequences is inspiring.

## When the Game Was Ours {#when_the_game_was_ours}

Very disappointing. I was a big fan while they played the game but that wasn&#8217;t enough to make [this book][8] worth reading. 

## I Am Ozzy {#i_am_ozzy}

The great and powerful Ozzy tries desperately to remember details from his thirty plus years as the prince of darkness. Unfortunately, his memory is shot. The only redeeming feature in [this book][9] is that it was clearly written (dictated) by Ozzy himself (unlike the previously mentioned book which was almost certainly not written by Bird and Johnson).

## The Others {#the_others}

There are other books I read that are not worth mentioning and still more I did not get a chance to read. I&#8217;ve made [a wishlist][10]<img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> of the books I&#8217;d like to read eventually.
