In 1999, I was all excited about using online tools to read and study the Scriptures. It was part of my daily routine. I quickly gave up on this for the convenience of using &#8216;a real Bible.&#8217; In the last couple years I have shown my students where these tools are and how to find them, but I don&#8217;t really use them myself. Another teacher (who is not a hacker by any means) shared during devotions one day about how she uses her WebTV to hear the scriptures read to her, but it didn&#8217;t really push me to get back into it.My father-in-law was here about ten days ago and he asked me what I knew about online Bibles and bible study. I told him what little I knew, but had to admit that I know very little.His question nudged me to look into this again for a couple of reasons. 

  1. I want to give him a report of some things I find
  2. I have been thinking about introducing him to RSS for some time now, and even mentioned to him the possiblility of podcasting his sermons
  3. I have been planning on researching these and other Christian resources for another project I thought of when my Dad passed away.

Anyway, I found [these][1] to start with.
