A little while ago, before I saw Dunkirk, my daughter asked me "which are your favorite three Nolan films?"

<!--more-->

Two of his films are among my favorites overall, but I never considered myself a huge Nolan fan. So, I had to consider the third very carefully. I thought _Inception_ was overrated. I thought _Interstellar_ was underrated. _The Dark Knight_ was fantastic, but sometimes I wonder if I didn't like _Batman Begins_ more than that.

<p style="clear:both;">Eventually, I came up with:</p>

1. _The Prestige_
2. _Mememto_
3. _The Dark Knight_

to which my daughter replied "interesting."

Turns out hers were:

1. _The Prestige_
2. _The Dark Knight_
3. _Memento_

until she saw _Dunkirk_. For her, that pushed _Memento_ off the list.

I don't really get it. I enjoy films that depict events from history - especially defining events like this one - and I enjoyed this one for that reason, but the movie just doesn't work for me. 
Though two of my favorite films of all time are Nolan's work (see above), I just don't really get most of them. I love the way Nolan insists on using as few special effects as possible and on telling stories in unusual ways, but I guess I think he doesn't always accomplish what he set out to do.

Unless, of course, what he set out to do was generate outrageous revenues and get people like me and my daughter debating which of his movies are the best. If that's his goal, he has certainly succeeded. 

I do think if you have the chance, you should see this on the big screen. The air combat scenes alone are worth the price of admission if you ask me.
