I haven&#8217;t posted too many links the last couple days. I have a bunch of guitar links to post &#8211; like I said [before][1], my links come in waves, but I&#8217;m not sure I want to post them all. Some of them generate popups. I have nothing against the [responsible use of popups][2], mind you. Some sites rely on them for revenue. I used them myself on the first two web projects I created ([here][3] and [here][4] &#8211; Both are under different management now.), but I don&#8217;t like the way some publishers use them.

Anyway, I did a search for guitar tablature and starting opening up results in tabs.<sup><a href="#firefox">1</a></sup>. As I clicked through the tabs it was clear that some sites were using popups onLoad and/or onExit. The interesting thing is that I couldn&#8217;t tell which sites. When I clicked one tab I would see another tab open with an ad, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if the ad was triggered by the site I was leaving or the one I was entering. It was an interesting (and somewhat annoying) experience. I don&#8217;t see a lot of popups partly because I use [FireFox][5], and partly because I don&#8217;t normally visit the kinds of sites that typically use them. I began to wonder if I wanted to link to these sites at all.So where do I draw the line? On the one hand, I don&#8217;t put much effort into &#8216;reviewing&#8217; sites before I post. My [linkblog][6] is not intended to be a set of recommendations. Normally I find a site I think someone may find a site interesting and I just click a toolbar button and tag it in <a href="http://del.icio.us/bsoist/" rel="tag">del.icio.us</a>. Don&#8217;t think too much about it. I click, pick a tag I think someone may use to search and I&#8217;m done. If I want to [Furl][7] the site for my benefit, I also attach the 2furl tag.On the other hand, I want the visitors to not hate the experience when they follow a link from my site. Will my readers hold a grudge for my behavior in this regard?I guess if I have a few extra minutes tomorrow I&#8217;ll load the pages one at a time and see which ones are the offenders.

<a title="firefox" name="firefox"></a>FireFox[FireFox][8] is the world&#8217;s best browser and is available for linux, windows and mac. It is highly customizable, has built-in RSS support, tabbed browsing and stops many of the popups (but not all obviously) you are destined to endure with inferior browsers.
