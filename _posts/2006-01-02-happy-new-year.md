I spent several hours of my 39th birthday at the Redskins v. Eagles game at the link on Sunday. I bought the tix as a Christmas present for Terri who is a huge Redskins fan. We enjoyed it very much especially since the skins made the playoffs and the Eagles failed to win a division game all season. :) I also put together a new look for this site. I wanted something a little less busy but still with all the links, photos, etc. Nothing fancy, but I like it.
