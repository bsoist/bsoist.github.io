Well, it&#8217;s been a while since my last post. I was planning on posting about some of my previous work, and I got distracted fooling with my link blog. Then I wanted to post all about that and Google announced its API for the maps. How cool is this?!!So, I have been busy (obsessed) with doin&#8217; the Google maps thing. Loads of fun!Some quick updates:
