[Does this loop ever end? (Scripting News)][1]
:   I could not agree more. Closed will never win.

[Church Marketing Sucks: Thou Shall Twitter in Church][2]
:   I don't have a problem with Twittering in church as much as I do Twittering while in the company of others and while one should be listening and meditating. </p> 
    
    On the other hand, sharing something does help make it real. 
    
    I would not be against using Twitter during church as long as I knew it wasn't a distraction from why I am there &#8211; which could easily be the case I think.</dd>

    :   This is one of the funniest things I've read in a long time. Bravo!
    
    [The 30 Best Films of the Decade][7]
    :   I have a couple more to see but I would have to agree with most on this list. My favorites &#8211; Memento, King of Kong, Son of Rambow, Up, Almost Famous, and Eternal Sunshine.</p> 
        
        Of course, there are some excellent "blockbusters" I liked too &#8211; Bourne, Potter, Dark Knight, Return of the King.</dd> 
        
        [Donâ€™t Listen To Stupid People][8]

        [How To Recognize an Idiot][12]
        :   Could not agree more &#8211; but what do I know. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </dl>
