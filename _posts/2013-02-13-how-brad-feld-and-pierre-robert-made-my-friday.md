I wasn’t having a particularly good day last Friday, which is a bad sign because Friday is one of my favorite days. Not for the reasons you might think &#8211; Monday is another favorite. I typically use Fridays to wrap up lose ends, catch up with people who’ve been waiting on me, etc. But this Friday was different. I had some unpleasant “running around” to do.

To complicate things even further, I had already arranged a meeting with someone who could barely squeeze me into his schedule for a Friday lunch, and then I had canceled that meeting and hadn’t heard confirmation that he got the message. I don’t have his phone number, so I leave the house thinking I’ll show up if I don’t get an email back from him. I’m probably going to be a few minutes late, but I’ll get there.

But I got stuck somewhere for a ridiculous amount of time. I won’t bore you with the details, but it involves an inefficient computer system, an angry policeman, and a green Camaro parked in the fire lane. Fortunately, I was an innocent bystander. Unfortunately, all of that required I stand and wait and wait and wait.

Anyway, I keep looking at the clock, and the time I have available to get where I need to go is getting smaller and smaller. And then, poof, it’s gone. Without getting into all the details I can’t really describe for you exactly how bad this day is getting for me. As a rule, I don’t have bad days, but this one is bad &#8211; really bad.

So far.

As I’m checking my email for confirmation that I’ve not left someone eating alone in a restaurant just a few miles from where I stand, I saw an email from Brad Feld. I assume he is replying to one of my emails, but I’m pleasantly surprised when I read “Bill &#8211; you are the winner! I’m going to [blog it][1] this morning. ”

I still have to deal with what I’m dealing with, but my day is getting better.

I finish my business, and hit the road. On the way, I decide to make a quick stop to try and make someone’s day brighter. That doesn’t work out, so I head straight home.

And Pierre Robert plays a block of Bon Jovi for my ride home. ( Not my favorite band, but the block made my day anyway. I posted a little [backstory yesterday][2] for those of you who simply can’t relate. )

So, that’s how Brad Feld and Pierre Robert made my day last Friday. Thanks a bunch guys! And thanks for rescheduling lunch Mark.

Sometimes [you don&#8217;t know if a good day is a good day][3].
