## 10. Huddle {#10_huddle}

Huddle by Google+ allows me to group chat with my friends via texting. I&#8217;ve tried group texting before but it has always been a let down because of differences in phones, etc. Huddle fixes that &#8211; so far.

## 9. Nearby {#9_nearby}

If you enable location services and access Google+ via mobile, you will find a stream labeled *Nearby*. I love browsing through that and finding new friends right around the corner.

## 8. Sparks {#8_sparks}

I was disappointed to learn this didn&#8217;t search Google+ itself, but more about that in another post. I love having these saved searches ready to view and I love being able to share directly from Sparks. 

## 7. Drag and Drop Sharing {#7_drag_and_drop_sharing}

I resisted using a mouse for years and still prefer the keyboard for a lot of things but dragging and dropping files is one thing I&#8217;ve really come to love. It just seems so intuitive to me. Love that I can drag something into Google+ and share it. 

## 6. Unlimited Photos on Picasa {#6_unlimited_photos_on_picasa}

I actually just learned about this today. Thanks to Chris Brogan for pointing that out. I pay for a Pro Flickr account and never used Picasa a whole lot because of the limit. Well, that&#8217;s gonna change. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

## 5. Integration with Google {#5_integration_with_google}

Speaking of Picasa &#8230; I love how Google+ is integrated into most (all?) of Google&#8217;s products and services. I&#8217;ve used Gmail since 2004, pay for extra storage, and use the Docs, calendars, and contacts. I even switched to using the web UI [a while back][1]. 

## 4. Hangouts {#4_hangouts}

Group video chatting and YouTube integration is awesome. This has potential for collaboration on creative project, business meetings, and just plan &#8220;hanging out.&#8221; Awesome!

## 3. Re-Sharing {#3_re_sharing}

I like being able to share content I discover with my friends easily. I am still sorting out all the etiquette, privacy, and noise issues, but I love this feature.

## 2. Circles {#2_circles}

I&#8217;ve read a lot about how these are no better than lists on Facebook and Twitter. I disagree! Using circles allows me to share selectively, read selectively, share by email with people not on Google+, and even set up private circles for sending content to Evernote or whatever. I&#8217;m not a big fan of using a circle to pretend to be friends with someone, but if that&#8217;s your game you can do that too.

## 1. No Farmville! {#1_no_farmville}
