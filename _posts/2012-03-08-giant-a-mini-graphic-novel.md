Rough day today. I woke up to a host of issues of my own as well as those of some clients. I was able to get my morning reading done before all of that happened, but I was quickly running out of time to find a project to back today.

So, I asked for some advice on Twitter and discoveredÂ [GIANT! &#8211; A Mini Graphic Novel][1]

It looks like a lot of fun, and since [I&#8217;ve rediscovered comics recently][2] (mostly due to my iPad) I decided it was a great project for today.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][3]Â and my backing history [over here][4].
