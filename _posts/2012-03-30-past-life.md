Recently [I mentioned][1] that I chose a project because my one and only Kickstarter follower had starred it. For the last two projects of this monthly challenge, I thought I would back projects which have been backed by two friends of mine who backed a project my son was involved in a few months ago. 

Today&#8217;s project is a novel entitled [*Past Life*][2], a project backed by [Todd Jordan][3] (someone I connected with on FriendFeed years ago).



See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][4] and my backing history [over here][5].

P.S. I actually have to back two projects today, since somehow I actually didn&#8217;t back one on Monday. I found it on Kickstarter, decided how much to chip in, posted all about it to my blog, but didn&#8217;t actually back it. Since I&#8217;m not doing that well with this month&#8217;s challenge, I am going to count it. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
