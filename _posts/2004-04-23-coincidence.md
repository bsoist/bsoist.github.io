This morning my alarm sounded nine minutes before I needed to rise. I always set it like this so that I can hit the snooze button once. I remember this morning vividly because the dj happened to be announcing the time when I woke.Over an hour later, thirteen minutes before I would normally leave for work, I woke on my own. The alarm was still set. I checked the radio. The signal was fine and the volume was up. There seemed to be no explanation for why I had overslept.Â I woke my wife for help getting Billy ready for school, and I began to prepare for work. On Friday, I normally arrive at work 2 hours and 25 minutes before my first class, so I knew that I would be okay. I was rather frantic about getting Billy to school on time. He is trying very hard to earn a perfect attendance award this year and I did not want to ruin that.Â As we arrived at school, we learned that a large flatbed truck had[crashed into the side of the school building.][1] This took place at the time we normally arrive at school. If I had not overslept, we would most certainly have just missed this incident *or worse*, **not missed it.**Â An event like this begs explanation. Let&#8217;s take a look at the two most common explanations for such an event.Â  

  1. Master PlanSomehow, the events and actions of the participants were *planned*. This explanation raises a number of questions indeed.Â 
Â  

  * CoincidenceThe [Yahoo! Dictionary][2] defines *coincidence* as follows:Â   
    > NOUN: &#8230;2. A sequence of events that althoughaccidental seems to have been planned orarranged.Â </p>
    Â </li> 
    
    Â </ol> 
    
    Â So essentially, either this **was** planned or it was **accidental** and simply **seems to have been planned**. I have never been comfortable with these glaringly opposite extremes. On the one hand, if something *seems to have been planned*, why **assume** that it was accidental. On the other, the master plan raises some very difficult quesitons in my mind. Too many questions in fact.Â I **choose** to believe:Â  
    
      * The *truth* lies somewhere in between these two possibilities
    Â  
    
      * I may never know the answers to some (indeed many) of life&#8217;s quesitons
    Â  
    
      * There is an Almighty God who actively sustains His creation
    Â  
    
      * Almighty God is a personal God who cares for and **protects** His people.
    Â </ul> 
    
    Â I thank God for protecting me as I travel to work every day. I am especially grateful for today&#8217;s *coincidence*. <happy></happy>Â

      The article linked above incorrectly reports the time of the incident. I arrived at 7:47 and the police and emergency vehicles had already arrived. Eyewitness accounts put the event at closer to 7:20.
