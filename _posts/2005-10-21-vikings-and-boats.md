Frankly, this kind of thing doesn&#8217;t surprise me. I know it should, but it doesn&#8217;t.I saw a report on ESPN that these guys believe they need to get out there and win. They believe that is the only way to redeem themselves. You know the sad thing is that they are right. People will forgive them as long as they win.[Vikings Face Boat-Load of New Problems][1][Some people never learn.][2]
