A while back I toyed with de.lirio.us for my link blog. I pulled the feed and transformed it into html. I used the html from my blog so it would have the same look. I was becoming less satisfied with de.lirio.us and started itching to use del.icio.us instead. I thought I could pull the feed and post each item to a real wordpress blog by dropping the data into the database. My solution is not pretty, but it works. I run a cron job daily to do the &#8216;pull and post.&#8217;I like it. I&#8217;ve poste the code in case you&#8217;re interested.<!--more-->
