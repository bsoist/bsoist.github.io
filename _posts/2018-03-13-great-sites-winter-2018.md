Years ago, I had a weekly feature on my blog where I showcased some great sites I had discovered. 

Haven't done it in a while, and I've discovered a few really cool sites I've saved to share sometime.

Enjoy...

* [Project Subway NYC][1] - Be sure to checkout the [3d models][1a] and [X-ray maps][[1b].
* [GitBook][5] - Something I definitely want to try soon.
* [Story Writer, by Amazon.com][2] - I'm intentionally using less of Amazon's stuff, but this is pretty cool.
* [Canva][3] - I use this from time to time to create designs and other stuff for pet projects.
* [Hemingway App][4] - A great tool for writing and editing your work.
