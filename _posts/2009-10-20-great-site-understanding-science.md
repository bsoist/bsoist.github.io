I&#8217;ve been planning to share this site whenever I was in the mood to talk about science.

After [yesterday&#8217;s post][1], this seemed as good a week as any.

One of my biggest concerns is that our high school students are graduating without a proper understanding of science and the scientific method. I&#8217;m especially concerned for students of Christian high schools, but also for Christians in non-religious schools, and for all high school students. I&#8217;m sure some schools do a better job than others, but I think we should be diligent about teaching our own children and doing the best we can to share with other students and parents.
