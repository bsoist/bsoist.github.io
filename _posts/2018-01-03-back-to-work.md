Most years, I take a couple of weeks to enjoy the holidays and I work a little bit here and there. 

Most years, I am excited to head back to a full-time work schedule.

This is not one of those years. I'm back to work full-time, and while I'm not dreading it, there is a little less excitement about it this time.
