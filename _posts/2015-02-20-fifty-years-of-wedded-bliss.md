If dad were here today, that's what he would have said. If mom were here, she would have laughed and rolled her eyes.

I miss them both very much, but it's so nice to have memories like that.

I learned a lot from my parents. As I get older I think more and more about that, and one thing I'm really glad I learned was how to be happy. I don't think my parents were always happy, but they certainly taught me how.

I will be eternally grateful!
