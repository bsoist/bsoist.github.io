[_The Post_][post] was a movie I didn't love that told two great stories. _The Shape of Water_ is a great film that tells a story I don't really get. 

Certainly worthy of the thirteen nominations it received. I think it's possible it will clean up at the awards this year, but it is my pick for only three. Three big ones, though.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Best Actress</h3>
If you ask me, this one is a lock. I would be sorely disappointed if Sally Hawkins doesn't win this one.

### Best Cinematography
As I've written about in the past, I am not sure I understand how they judge this category, and this year this is as tough a choice as I've seen before, but the imagery in this film was simply captivating throughout most of it. Brilliant work.

### Best Picture
Though this film is not my pick in many other categories, for most of them I would choose it second. All of that along with excellent performances all around, an intriguing story (whether I get it or not), the spectacular images, the way it makes you think - and feel! I left the theater thinking "I'm not sure how much I really liked that, but it should win best picture."
