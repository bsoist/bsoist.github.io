I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and writing about the Republican primary recently, so I decided not to post about the election today as I had originally planned. I did, however, have a bunch of links I wanted to share today, and since I wanted to comment on each one &#8230;

I changed plans again.

  * [I was wrong][1]
    
    > Politicians, of course, are terrible at this. They are never wrong, apparently, and when they are, spin instead of admitting it. Which not only hurts their trustworthiness, it prevents them from learning anything.

  * [Another Check on the Campaign&#8217;s Truthiness][2]
    
    > each [interesting] statement [is graded] as true, mostly true, half-true, mostly false, false or â€œpants on fireâ€

  * [The Great Taxer][3]
    
    With all the comparisons to Reagan, I thought this was worth reflecting on 
    
    > In fact, no peacetime president has raised taxes so much on so many people. This is not a criticism: the tale of those increases tells you a lot about what was right with President Reagan&#8217;s leadership, and what&#8217;s wrong with the leadership of George W. Bush.

  * Paul &#8211; [Paul pursued strategy of publishing controversial newsletters][4]
    
    I mentioned one problem I have with Ron Paul [the other day][5], but this also bothers me. I don&#8217;t mean to single Paul out as the only racist in the field. Gingrich and Santorum both use language (AND refuse to rebuke statements by supporters) that indicate either racism or a strategy to pander to racism for votes. I don&#8217;t recall anything from Romney, but as a Mormon he has probably been exposed to bit of racist ideology.

  * Romney &#8211; [What do Mormon&#8217;s believe?][6]
    
    Our Constitution clearly states there should be [no religious test][7] and I support that in a very big way, but I&#8217;ve got a real problem with what some people believe. In other words, I think he has every right to run for and hold public office, but I think any thinking person should be aware of what he believes &#8211; because it&#8217;s evidence of how he thinks.

  * Gingrich &#8211; [The &#8220;War on Christianity&#8221;][8]
    
    I&#8217;ve got a lot of problems with this guy, but this kind of rhetoric is maddening to me. An historian as brilliant as he, should know better.

  * Santorum
    
    I know this isn&#8217;t going to be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea, but this sums it up for me. I&#8217;ve said before that I think Santorum seems like a nice enough guy and very sincere. On the matters of character and integrity he beats Gingrich and Romney hands down, but I want no part of his brand of big government.
