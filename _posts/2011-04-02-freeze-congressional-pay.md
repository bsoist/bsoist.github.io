Over the course of the last month, many have [Facebook users have proposed pay cuts for Congress][1]. Many believe it&#8217;s the right thing to do in our current economic condition. Others think it is only fair when other sectors of the population are being forced into pay cuts.

I&#8217;m not going to argue with any of that. 

I do, however, have an issue with one point &#8211; will this help bring down the national debt?

The answer is simple &#8211; Not really, the money involved is statistically insignificant when compared to the national debt.

Let&#8217;s look at the best numbers I can find. I didn&#8217;t spend too much time researching this but I think I can make up for that by inflating the numbers a bit.

## Senate Salaries $20,054,620 {#senate_salaries_20054620}

The party leaders each earn $193,400 and &#8220;rank and file&#8221; members each earn $174,000.

  </tr>
</table>

Let&#8217;s adjust this for taxes, etc. $17,483,800 x 1.15 = $20,054,620

## House Salaries $88,345,530 {#house_salaries_88345530}

The Speaker of the House earns $223,500, party leaders $193,400, &#8220;rank and file&#8221; $174,000.

I am making the assumption that the six non-voting member (Puerto Rico, Guam, DC, etc.) are paid members.

Let&#8217;s adjust this for taxes, etc. $76,822,200 x 1.15 = $88,345,530

## Retired $30,983,000 {#retired_30983000}

I did find [current information][2] about congressional pensions. It contains one useful bit of information for my purposes today &#8211; the maximum annual pension is 80% of the three year high salary. This puts the maximum pension for anyone that retires in 2011 at $178,800. Note that this is more than most congressman ever make. It is ridiculously incorrect because it assumes **every** retired member served as Speaker of the House for at least three years.

The best information I could find about members currently collecting was from 2007. At that time, 413 retirees were collecting an average of $64,000 per year and 123 were collecting an average of $37,000 per year for a total of $30,983,000.

Let&#8217;s overestimate these costs a bit. Let&#8217;s raise everyone&#8217;s benefits to the maximum AND retire everyone in congress and replace them today (sounds good, right?).

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now let&#8217;s assume that every current congressperson supports a staff whose salaries total **five times** their own salary. 

If we add that to our total and add taxes, we get &#8230;

($287,543,900 + ( $93,264,000 x 5 ) ) x 1.15 = $866,943,485

## How does this affect the national debt? {#how_does_this_affect_the_national_debt}

You know what? Let&#8217;s just round this up to $1,000,000,000 a year. Why not?

That&#8217;s $2,737,850.79 per day, which sounds like a lot, right?

**Wrong?**

The national debt is currently growing at $4.07 billion per day. **IF** we were really spending $2,737,850.79 per day (which we know is a huge stretch) **AND** we pulled the stop on **ALL PAY** &#8211; not a freeze on pay, not a pay cut, but a **TOTAL ELIMINATION OF ALL PAY** for all retired and current congress persons and their staffs!!

$2,737,850.79 / $4,070,000,000 = 0.0006726906117936118

This would decrease the growth of our budget from $4,070,000,000 to 4,067,262,149.21 per day &#8211; a reduction of 0.06726906117936118 percent! 

To put this in perspective, let&#8217;s look at an example. Suppose you are overspending on your home budget by $150,000 per month. It doesn&#8217;t take much imagination to see how much trouble this would bring in short order. Now suppose your &#8220;plan&#8221; to reduce that deficit is to stop buying your morning coffee ($25 per week). 

No help, right?

BUT you would be doing **MORE** to reduce your deficit than the savings our government would gain by **TOTALLY ELIMINATING ALL CONGRESSIONAL PAY.**
