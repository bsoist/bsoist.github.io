Some time ago, someone asked me to participate in an exciting project. 

Now, more than eighteen months later, I can tell all of you about it. 

The project was to create a full featured multiplayer first person shooter for iPhone and iPod touch &#8211; and it is now available on the [App Store][1].

If you are interested in my work, you can learn more about my part [over here][2](link dead now). If you just want to get straight to the iPwnage, go download the game now &#8211; [low price, no gimmicks, no tricks][1].

UPDATE:
Since the link above is now dead, I wanted to detail what I did for this project.

* Built a self-scaling architecture to handle load for millions of players. AWS now provides a lot of this functionality as a part of their offering, but they did not at this time.
* Built a system for tracking ll player scoring and achievements. Apple had not yet released Game Center so we didn't have that option either.
* Built the match-making system which matched players to other players in the same part of the world and with similar rankings.
* Built all of the in-game menus.
* Designed and implemented all database schema.
