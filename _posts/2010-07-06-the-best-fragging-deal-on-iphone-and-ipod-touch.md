Some time ago, someone asked me to participate in an exciting project. 

Now, more than eighteen months later, I can tell all of you about it. 

The project was to create a full featured multiplayer first person shooter for iPhone and iPod touch &#8211; and it is now available on the [App Store][1].

If you are interested in my work, you can learn more about my part [over here][2]. If you just want to get straight to the iPwnage, go download the game now &#8211; [low price, no gimmicks, no tricks][1].
