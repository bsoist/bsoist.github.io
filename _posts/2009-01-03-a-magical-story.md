I picked up *The Vanished Man* at a hospital reading room when I desperately needed a way to escape the reality of what was happening. It would have been difficult to have chosen a more fitting tale. Deaver&#8217;s mix of forensic crime solving and the world of magic, gave me just the kind of engrossing escape from reality I was hoping for.

I&#8217;d read one other Lincoln Rhyme novel before. While I enjoyed it, it left only a mild impression on me. This one was different. Lincoln supposes the villain he is looking for is an illusionist, so he recruits a young magician to help. As a result, the tale becomes a fascinating one, a typical forensic crime mystery filled with tales of magic &#8211; including &#8220;insider&#8221; information.
