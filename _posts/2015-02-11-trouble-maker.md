Anyone who knows me probably understands why I list "trouble maker" in my online bio almost everywhere I am online. I'm writing this for those that have asked.

People tend to look at the world through a lens. That lens is crafted by our parents, our teachers, our friends, and our experiences. Most people have a very hard time looking at things through the someone else's lens. Many of the historical figures I most admire - Copernicus, Galileo, Charles Darwin - challenged people to do that.

Others - Ghandi, MLK, Sam Adams, Rosa Parks - refused to accept the way things were.

They all had one thing in common - they made trouble. We may not always think of them that way, but they made people think and that causes trouble.

I'd like to think I do that whenver I can.
