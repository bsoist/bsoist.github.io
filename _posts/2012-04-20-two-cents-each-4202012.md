[Making simple connections][1]
:   ESR makes several excellent points here. Our connectedness in the 21st century boggles the mind. His best point, if you ask me, is this &#8211; &#34;Sometimes the most important connection of all is just knowing that a given thing is possible.&#34;

[Freakonomics Â» Markets in the Air][2]
:   Am I the only one who doesn't really see the market here? Do I really need someone to watch my kids when I'm right there? I don't really get it. And, yes, I have flown with kids &#8211; many, many times.

[Climate and the culture war &#8211; The Washington Post][3]
:   Something is really going on here when this debate reaches the level of religious fervor. I'm dumbfounded by the way this issue has risen to this level. It's nonsensical.

[The Rise of the New Groupthink &#8211; NYTimes.com][4]
:   Very excellent points indeed. I see the value in collaboration and I especially think schools should not label all collaboration cheating (that doesn't prepare them for the real world at all), but the danger on the other extreme is too much groupthink &#8211; no question about it. Solitude is more valuable than people realize.
