Jay at [Stop the ACLU][1] reads this:  

> About 20 gay inmates were forced to remove their clothes in a busy hallway July 19 at the Men's Central Jail while being called names and taunted with vulgar sexual language by some deputies, the ACLU said in a letter to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, citing inmates' claims.

at [The Java Report][2] and says this in response:  

> Didn't I just have someone in the comment section saying that ALL speech should be protected no matter how much you dislike it? Something about a slippery slope, I think.

He goes on to explain that he does not condone what was done, BUT blah blah&#8230;I just wanted to put in my two cents &#8211; calling gay inmates names **should be** protected by the First Amendment. Forcing them to remove their clothes in a public place (or any place, in fact) **should not** be protected. Any questions?
