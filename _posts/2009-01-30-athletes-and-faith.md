The NFL is a private organization and can essentially do what it wants, but some people have suggested that it doesn&#8217;t do enough to tone down the religious overtones. 

[This video][1] implies that even the officials make judgement calls based on religious intent.

It&#8217;s also clear that athletes can make public statements of faith in cases where statements of another kind would not be tolerated. The recent [discussions of Tim Tebow&#8217;s eyeblack][2] demonstrates that not everyone is happy about this. 

What do you think?
