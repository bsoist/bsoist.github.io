The Mets really let us down this year. 

Billy and I went to Shea for five games (and one rainout) this year. All of our games were after the change in management and it seemed as though the Mets were on a roll. We were certain the Mets would not disappoint us as they did last season. 

We also took the girls with us for a game against the Phillies. We had timed it just right. The Mets tied with the Phils for the NL East lead on Sunday 7/20. Both teams were off on Monday and our game was for Tuesday. The Mets beat up on the Philles for more than 7 innings and then it all fell apart. It turned from one of the best days of my life to one of the worst &#8211; all in the space of an hour or less. 

It was a microcosm of the season really.

One of the games we did get to attend turned out to the last game played at Shea. We&#8217;d planned for it to be the last **regular season **game. We were perfectly willing to let others enjoy the last games if they were in the playoffs. 

I didn&#8217;t expect the Mets to do much in the playoffs but I wanted them to prove to me that they would not collapse again. 

I was in Philly today. I left by 3 so I didn&#8217;t get caught up in the mayhem for the 4:35 game. I have to tell you that I was jealous. All those fans enjoying their team&#8217;s success. I was a little sick. 

Watching game two now and the Phillies are in the midst of a rally. Ugh.

Go Dodgers!
