Roger Ebert calls this film &#8220;masterful filmmaking&#8221; and I could not agree more. I am such a fan of Michael Shannon and this is one of his finest performances. The film expertly examines every man&#8217;s fear of losing the &#8220;good life&#8221; he has. Highly recommended.

Not as good as the first or the third films, but a great film and a lot of fun to watch. There are several sequences that are perfect action film. There are a lot of references to the third film, so I wished I had re-watched that first ( which I would not mind doing since I loved that one ), but it didn&#8217;t have any effect on my understanding of this film. If you like fun adventure films, I highly recommend this one.

A great film. Like most startups in the genre, it was slow at the beginning during the set up of the hero, but the action picks up midway through and it turns out to be an entertaining film. Nothing is better than Captain America fighting the Nazis.

A few action sequences made this fun to watch at times, but it didn&#8217;t really work on any other level. A bad film.
