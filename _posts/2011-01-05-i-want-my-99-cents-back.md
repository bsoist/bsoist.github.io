I am a theist but I believe wholeheartedly that our universe was created in a big bang and has evolved over billions of years. I also have no reason to question the current scientific consensus that all life on this planet evolved from a common ancestor over the last several billion years. As a matter of fact, I find the whole idea of evolution to be an incredible example of our Creator&#8217;s omnipotence. 

So when I found myself on an app downloading spree a few weeks ago I decided to purchase an app titled &#8220;[Evolution Debater][1]&#8221; for my iPad. I thought I might use it and I thought it would be nice to support the developer.

A few days ago I tried it for the first time and I was very disappointed. I develop apps myself so I would normally not complain about an app which cost me only 99 cents but this app is different. It made me angry. Since I am going to complain anyway, I&#8217;ll write a quick review. 

## Overview {#overview}

The app is a simple collection of questions about evolution and answers in support of evolutionary theories. According to the developer &#8220;it is meant to help teach others about evolution and help in debates in favor of evolution.&#8221;

## The Good {#the_good}

  1. The answers to most of the questions are, in my opinion, very solid. 
  2. Only $0.99 for iPad, free for iPhone. 
  3. Fair treatment of intelligent design. I am not really a supporter of the ID &#8220;movement&#8221; but I like to see fair treatment. 

## The Bad {#the_bad}

  1. There only 26 questions listed and one could argue that one does not belong. 
  2. The app has a few typos &#8211; I am sure this post does too. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

This translates to low value in my book. Compare this to [my last iPhone/iPad project][2] to see what you can get for $0.99. 

## The Ugly {#the_ugly}

Almost dead center among the &#8220;questions&#8221; is something which reads &#8220;Unfulfilled Prophecy.&#8221; Tapping on it reveals an &#8220;answer&#8221; that begins with &#8220;The Bible misinterprets its own prophecies&#8221; and then goes on in an attempt to discredit the &#8220;alleged Word of God.&#8221;

I really wouldn&#8217;t mind if someone wanted to have an open debate on these issues but I was furious that someone would stick that in there. We have enough problems with Christians fighting amongst themselves over ridiculous assertions about &#8220;creation science&#8221; &#8211; we don&#8217;t need this. 

I want my 99 cents back!
