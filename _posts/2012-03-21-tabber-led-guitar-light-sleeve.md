Today&#8217;s project is [Tabber, an open-source LED guitar teacher][1]. 

From the project page &#8230;

> Tabber creates a whole new field of visual learning for your guitar. We put the notes that you need to play, when you need to play them right on the neck of the guitar. Our LED light sleeve can be placed on or off the guitar at any time. The light system does not affect the sound of the guitar in any way, and it&#8217;s tactual feel is barely noticeable, especially for beginners. The kit contains 13 light strips (12 frets plus open notes) which are all connected to an Arduino Uno processor. Power is supplied through a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The kit will utilize Bluetooth technology to control all of the lights from your mobile device. You will have an application that you can download to select through songs, chords, scales, light patterns, and lessons, and that&#8217;s just the start.
