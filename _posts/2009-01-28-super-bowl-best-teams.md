I&#8217;ve always preferred college football to the NFL. Teams always seemed to take chances in order to earn points in the eyes of voters. I understand that this may take away from the strategy necessary to win a game in some cases, but it gives the game a level of excitement that is not present in a more conservative gameplan. 

That being said, I&#8217;ve come away from many seasons with a sense of disappointment at the way the national champion was decided. Not this season, mind you &#8211; I&#8217;m very happy my Gators pulled it off <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> but in many other seasons, I&#8217;ve been less than excited. 

I was hopeful when the BCS was instituted, and in my opinion it has done a better job of choosing a champion than the previous system. My problem with the BCS is that it seems to have ruined the bowl season. What I remember as one or two days of great football has become almost two weeks of mostly inconsequential games named after greedy corporations. 

So, like many others I have been spouting off at the mouth about how college football needs a playoff of some kind. I&#8217;ve been a big proponent of [a &#8220;plus one&#8221; system][1]. When Barack Obama started talking about it, I was thrilled. Not because I want my president to worry about such trivialities, but because I was glad to hear that someone of his intelligence (and sports fan status) would agree with me.

But now I have to wonder if I am on the right side of the debate. Are we headed in the wrong direction? If we can stick to the current system I think things will be okay, but can we do that? Will a plus-one system simply lead to more controversy? If it does, will that not eventually lead to a full-blown playoff system? and is that what we want?

I&#8217;m not sure. If there were a playoff system, I think I would be disappointed. First, one of the things I like most about college football, playing for &#8220;style points,&#8221; will not be as significant a factor. Second, we may end up with a definitive yet mediocre champion. I did not think much about this until I read [this piece][2] in which the author makes a very strong argument that the playoff system in the NFL simply doesn&#8217;t work. Someone at SI [raises the same issue][3]. I&#8217;d argue that is even the case in other professional sports. 

On the other hand, maybe it&#8217;s the process we enjoy anyway. Who doesn&#8217;t love the NCAA basketball tournament? One of the things I like best about March Madness is that anything can happen, yet that&#8217;s what I like least about the NFL playoffs.

I guess I really have no idea what I want now.
