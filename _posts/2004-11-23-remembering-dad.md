I shared some of my Dad&#8217;s favorite Scriptures in devotions yesterday. It was difficult to do. Someone had to pass me a box of tissues about half-way through. I had to ask someone to finish reading Psalm 34:1-8. It was worth it no matter how hard. Several people came to me to tell me how glad they were I shared. My father was an amazing man. I miss him very much.
