UPDATE: I actually didn&#8217;t back this one, but I&#8217;m counting it because I did the hard part on the 26th &#8211; I logged in, found the project, decided how much to chip in, and blogged about it. I have since actually backed it. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Today&#8217;s project is [PressurePen][1], a pressure sensitive stylus for iPads and Android tablets.



From the project page &#8230;

> Professional artists and interested amateurs love to use their iPads to draw and sketch ideas, take notes, and produce original artwork. Even the best stylus currently on the market has the limitation that it can only present a single level of pressure to the tablet â€” drawing is either on or off. To mimic variable pressure, a number of software tricks have been developed, but none realistically reproduce natural media or the direct feedback of a pressure-sensitive stylus.
> 
> In addition to the iPad, there are a growing number of excellent Android tablets that could benefit from pressure sensitivity. Integrated active digitizers exist, based mainly on proprietary Wacom technology, built into the tablet itself.
