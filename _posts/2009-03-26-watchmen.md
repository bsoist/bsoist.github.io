I don&#8217;t usually read graphic novels. Not because I am too old for them but because my eyesight is very poor. This one was an exception. After a very strong recommendation from my son and armed with the knowledge that Time magazine named it one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923, I grabbed my magnifying glass and set out to read this before the movie release.

I finished just in time for the movie and I am glad I did. I&#8217;ve since heard reports that many viewers couldn&#8217;t follow the movie &#8211; I did not have any trouble at all.

Anyway, I&#8217;ll post thoughts on the movie Saturday but I very much enjoyed the book. It was a fascinating read. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of super-heroes. I realize that&#8217;s odd for a geek, but it&#8217;s true. I actually don&#8217;t care much for science fiction either &#8211; another oddity for a geek. What I do like, however, is time travel stories and alternate realities. I am also a fan of political science. If you&#8217;ve heard anything about the novel, and I&#8217;m sure many of you have, then you know this book holds a lot of promise for me.

Watchmen is an alternate reality which deconstructs the very concept of the super hero. It is based in a world where Nixon does not resign and where a man exists who is essentially as powerful as God Himself. It is full of though-provoking ideas related to the natures of time and freedom. It is worth a read for the content alone.

You should note, however, that this is not a book for kids. It explores very dark ideas and touches on very mature topics. You should also know that the edition I link to in this post is worth the purchase if you are fan of graphic novels. If you are a fan of graphic novels, I&#8217;m sure you already know that. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
