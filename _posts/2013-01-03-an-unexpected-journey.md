Almost three weeks ago, my daughter and I went to see this excellent film. We had both been looking forward to the film for some time, but I know she was most excited because she finally got to see a midnight movie on opening day. I&#8217;ve been meaning to share my thoughts for a while, but since today is Tolkien&#8217;s birthday, this is as good a time as any.

As a big fan of the books, I was a little worried about the film. The good news is that my fears were not realized. The bad news is that the film was still a disappointment. No doubt I enjoyed it, and the time with my daughter. A couple of scenes were fantastic and I enjoyed seeing some of the same imagery from the LOTR trilogy, but other parts of the movie had me scratching my head. 

One of the advantages of a good book &#8211; and this one was a masterpiece, in my opinion &#8211; is that you get to imagine it yourself. The disadvantage of the film is that you are seeing what someone else imagines. To me, this film suffers from that in a big way. I didn&#8217;t read much of the book the way the filmakers did, apparently. 

If you&#8217;re as big a fan of the book as I, then you may want to steer clear of the film, but something tells me you won&#8217;t. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> You might, though, want to check out Paul Gould&#8217;s excellent piece from yesterday &#8211; [Lessons from the Hobbit][1].
