Billy came to visit for Easter weekend, he stopped by the library to pick up something interested for us to watch. He decided on *The Decalogue*, a series of ten one-hour films written for Polish television in 1989. Each film represents one of the ten commandments.

We did not get a chance to see all of them, but I enjoyed the ones I watched very much. Very good filmmaking. 

We also watched a great film again (the second time for all of us, third time for Billy) &#8211; [The Muppets][1] is a great film.

I also watched Star Trek (2009) again when Becky and Terri were away. Didn&#8217;t really like it as much the second time.
