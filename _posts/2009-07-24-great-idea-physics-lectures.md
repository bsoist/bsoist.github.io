I&#8217;ve always believed that the world would be a much better place if more people understood physics and geometry.

Thanks to Bill Gates (did I just type that?) more people can come one step closer to my dream. [According to CNET][1] Bill Gates has acquired a series of lectures by noted physicist [Richard Feynman][2] and is making them available on the web for free on [Microsoft&#8217;s research website][3].

Great idea Bill, Thanks!
