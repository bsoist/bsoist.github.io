I obsess over things. I'm not going to deny that. 

One things I've obsessed over for a long time is the way I [share links][links].

I joined [This][this] the other day, but I haven't shared anything yet. Since I can only share one link per day, I thought I'd try and dig back and share some of my favorite finds from years past. I decided to give it some thought. What have I read that I just had to tell everyone about.

I only had to think for a few minutes before I remembered a great story written by one of the web's best story tellers - Jeffrey Zeldman. I've written about his work before, most recently I [mentioned him a few days ago][zeldman].

I can't promise I'll share stuff that great every day, but it will be fun trying.

Anyway, here it is - [Cameron Diaz and Me][diaz]
