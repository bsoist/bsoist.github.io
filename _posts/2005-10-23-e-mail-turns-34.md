[Official Google Blog: Guess what just turned 34?][1]I remember when I first disovered e-mail. It was 1979. My parents purchased my brother and I a TRS-80 color computer, and a 300 baud modem. Of course, we used the modem to dial our friends directly to &#8216;chat&#8217; and to connect to a couple of very cool BBSs. The computer did come with an introductory membership to compuserve which included e-mail. The connection was $12.95 per hour, so we never used it after the free trial ran out, but I remember thinking how cool the idea of e-mail was. Remember those e-mail addresses 7,12345,678@compuserve.com.Almost seven years would go by before I actually sent an e-mail to someone I knew. Of course by the early nineties I was using it all the time. And now &#8211; I get 1000&#8242;s of e-mails a day. I still love it, though!BTW, I still keep in touch with many of those friends and the guys who ran the BBSs.
