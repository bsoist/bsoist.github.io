Today&#8217;s project is [Double Fine Adventure][1], an interesting project that involves both video game development and a documentary film.

From the project page &#8230;

> The world of video game design is a mysterious one. What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood. And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be. With this project, we&#8217;re taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
