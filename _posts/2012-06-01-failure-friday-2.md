I&#8217;ve been working on these [12&#215;12 challenges (or 12ers) ][1]every month in 2012.

Well, in every month but May. Not only did I not follow through on a goal for May, I didn&#8217;t even set one. I had one thing in mind for several months in a row, but I kept pushing it back for new ideas. On the first of May, I decided on a new idea right away. By the next day I had changed my mind and thought I&#8217;d come up with something better. Never did.

To top things off, I also dropped the ball on the 750words.com challenge again (though I did have a 28 day streak at one point April to May (interestingly enough, I missed the 19th of both months &#8211; that&#8217;s where my sticking point is I guess (thought I did have a 28 day streak at one point between April and May).

In June, I&#8217;m finally going to get to that idea I keep putting off.
