The last time I posted about the Mets I was starting to wonder if the good news was over. Since then, we swept the Rays, were swept by the Reds, and then swept the Os. 

R.A. Dickey&#8217;s pitching has been almost perfect, David Wright is playing fantastic baseball, and the team is playing like it wants to win.

To top of a great week, the subway series starts today. I&#8217;m hoping for revenge for the last one &#8211; this time a sweep for the Mets instead.
