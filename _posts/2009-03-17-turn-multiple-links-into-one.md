I&#8217;ve just stumbled upon two sites which provide a simple but very handy service. You can use each to turn a list of links into one link.

If you&#8217;ve ever needed to send a list of links to someone via e-mail or IM, you may have benefited from one of these services.

The sites are [1link.in][1] and [linkbun.ch][2]. They are almost identical. On both sites you enter URLs one per line and click a button. This takes you to a page with a new link you can share. Clicking on that link takes will take your friends to a landing page that shows them the list of links so they can click on them separately, and a button which will open all the links at once in a tab enabled browser.

[1link.in][1] allows you to password protect your link, while [linkbun.ch][2] allows you to click a special link on the landing page that copies the links to the clipboard.

Giving your users the option to open all links at once is nice, but I was looking for something that would save me a bit of time so I put together a simple app to give me more what I was looking for you. You can check it out [over here][3].
