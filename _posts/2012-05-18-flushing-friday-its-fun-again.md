I was having a conversation with a fellow Mets fan the other day ( they are few and far between here in Phillies territory ) and I mentioned how it really is fun to be a Mets fan again. There is, no doubt, still some trepidation about their performance. It seems every time they lose a game, or even play sloppily, I begin to wonder what might happen next. Worse, when they lose two in a row, I start to wonder if this is the beginning of their certain plunge into last place. Aside from that, it is fun to be a Mets fan.

Mets fans, more than fans of most teams it seems, have learned the old baseball adage &#8220;there&#8217;s always next year.&#8221; But this year feels like it could be the year. Do I think our teem is destined for a world championship based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far? Of course not, but it&#8217;s fun to be a Mets fan again. I&#8217;ve enjoyed watching the games, reading the box scores, and once again I feel like there is hope for a winning season. 

A few losses this week, a bit of second guessing by the fans, and <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120515&#038;content_id=31389550&#038;vkey=news_mlb&#038;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">the &#8220;non issue&#8221; between David Wright and Terry Collins</a> has made for a week not quite as positive as last week, but the Mets <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304371504577406503296261304.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">are still performing offensively</a>. If we can keep that up, it should be a good season.
