> McGurn said that at least Google disclosed to potential shareholders up front that it intended to fund philanthropy through the corporation. But, he added, there is a danger that the &#8220;lines get blurred between how founders view corporate assets and personal assets.&#8221;

[Google Starts Up Philanthropy Campaign][1]

I&#8217;m confused by this whole thing.

Many companies give like this. Many stockholders support it. Many don&#8217;t.I am not sure Google&#8217;s founders are &#8216;blurring&#8217; any line. I think they know what they&#8217;re doing. Stockholders have every right to speak out. If enough stockholders disagree, fine. Until then we should all wish other companies would aspire to do good.
