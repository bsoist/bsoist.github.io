Well, maybe not &#8230;

My [12in12 goal][1] this month was to [back a different kickstarter project every day][2]. To be honest, I thought this would be easy after the first two months. I was wrong.

In January, my goal was to stick to my morning routine &#8211; get up early and read before I started work for the day. Not only did I stick to it every day in January, but I have every day since except for February 1. 

In February, it was back on a good diet. I stuck to that very well in February, but not as well since.

I knew finding a project I cared enough about to back every day might not be that easy, so I even cheated a bit. I spent the last couple days of February finding and saving some projects I might back in the event I got stuck one day.

All I needed to do was login, find a project, back it, and write about it. 

I&#8217;m ashamed to admit that I failed to do just that 11 out of 31 times. Well, unless you don&#8217;t count [this one][3].
