It&#8217;s interesting the things that remind me of Dad.Â On our way to my brother&#8217;s for Thanksgiving, we drove througth one of the most dangerous highway interchanges in the country; and it reminded me of Dad. I remember clipping an article from the paper about the proposed reconstruction project. I brought it to Dad&#8217;s on a visit once and we talked about how dangerous this place really was and how this plan looked like it would help, etc.Â Actually, I&#8217;m disappointed he didn&#8217;t get to see the project finished. Is that wierd?Â
