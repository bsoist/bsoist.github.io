On January 22, Kobe Bryant scored 81 points in a single NBA game. This is an amazing feat which one can&#8217;t help compare to Wilt&#8217;s 100 point game. A [Sports Illustrated article][1] which reminds us of the difference in stature between the two players even prompted some to hail Kobe&#8217;s performance as superior given he is six inches shorter than Wilt. While I think this is a ridiculuos idea, I couldn&#8217;t help but put together a <a href="/nbarecord.xls" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> to determine what it takes to &#8220;break the record.&#8221; I factored in three point shots while I was at it. Of course, I couldn&#8217;t resist an [online version][2] as well.:)On a related note, I read [another interesting article][3] about a man who gave up tickets to see Wilt&#8217;s 100 and Kobe&#8217;s 81!
