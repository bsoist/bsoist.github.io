I just finished this book and I recommend it highly.

The publisher describes *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* as &#8220;the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which is the best functional programming language around&#8221; and for now I&#8217;ll have to agree. I read the book as part of my Safari subscription but I was pleased to learn that you can still [read it online for free][1]. You can also, of course, purchase it if you prefer ([Print][2]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1593272839&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&nbsp;|&nbsp;[Kindle][3]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B004VB3V0K&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />).

I&#8217;ve used functional programming before and am a bit of a fan, but I&#8217;ve not used Haskell. I recently started reading [this blog][4]. Since the author uses Haskell for the examples, I set off on a quest to find a good book &#8211; and I found one.

*Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* is written for programmers but I get the sense that anyone who understands a bit of advanced mathematics would benefit from and enjoy reading it. I&#8217;m a programmer so it&#8217;s hard for me to tell for sure &#8211; but that&#8217;s the sense I get.

If you are looking for a good introduction to functional programming or Haskell, this book is probably a good first step.
