I just can't get used to using email over the web.
I decided to give Thunderbird another try. I'm glad I did. The goofy interface I remember is from the Windows version. What I'm using now doesn't seem so bad. It's not quite the way I would have designed it, but I like it.
A little slower than using the web, but it's fine for the way I do email.
