Twenty-three years ago today I married the girl of my dreams. We&#8217;ve lived happily ever after since then. The title of this post is a running joke at our house. It&#8217;s what my dad would have on his 23rd wedding anniversary. Actually, I&#8217;m sure he did say it just like he did every other year. 

Terri and I were out for a nice dinner about a week ago. I don&#8217;t remember what about our conversation led me to say this, but at one point I told her that &#8220;I could have married a hundred other woman and they would have all divorced me by now &#8211; with extreme prejudice!&#8221; 

As I read that now, I realize it might require some explanation. I did not, in fact, have one hundred other women waiting in the wings to marry me. That&#8217;s not what I meant at all. What I meant was that if I were to have married one hundred other women, they would have all given up on me. 

I believe that. As a matter of fact, I might have very nearly the same failure rate with a thousand others. 

I actually think I&#8217;m a good husband and a good father, but let&#8217;s just say that living with me is a bit of an adventure &#8211; the kind of adventure I think a lot of woman are not in the mood for. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Our time together has been wonderful. I look forward to another twenty-three years.
