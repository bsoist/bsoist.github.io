I am very excited the work being done on <a href="http://fargo.io/blog/">Fargo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher">Fargo Publisher</a>. I'm keeping my eye on those developments, and I'll probably set up my own server to run it very soon - for myself and others hopefully.
But I am still using my own homegrown system to render and upload my outlines to S3. 
I'm not sure I would encourage others to use it at this point because I did make some decisions in the blind and reverse engineering things based on live examples. This means that toggling between my system and Fargo Publisher - or using them at the same time - causes things to break.
Now that the <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/07/myTemplatesAreOpenSource.html">standard Fargo templates are available</a>, I may change things up so that the systems work similarly.
Now might not be the time for you to try it, but I did want to point out that I <a href="http://www.bsoi.st/fargoToXhtml">published the code</a> I use via Github.
