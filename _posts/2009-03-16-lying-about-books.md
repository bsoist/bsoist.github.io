[Kottke][1] points out [an interesting list][2] of books people lie about having read.

I&#8217;ve read all of numbers 1, 4, 6, and 10.

The only one I ever lied about was number one. I read about half of it in high school and told people I&#8217;d read it for several years. Then I realized I needed to read the whole thing.Â 

On a side note, I can&#8217;t believe Jason did not get past page 20 of *The Selfish Gene*. I think Richard Dawkins is a pompous, arrogant snoot and I don&#8217;t subscribe to his devotion to Darwinist explanations for all evolution, BUT I think the writing is compelling.

What books have you lied about reading?
