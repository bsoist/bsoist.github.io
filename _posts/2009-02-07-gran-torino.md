In a strange twist of circumstances, I ended up seeing this film twice. After the second viewing I am even more disappointed that Clint Eastwood was not nominated for acting (directing too probably). The academy nominated the same films for directing and best picture which I think is a lazy call to begin with, but that is not something I want to rant about now.

I fully expect the actor who wins the Oscar to mention this performance &#8211; it was brilliant. When Walt (Clint Eastwood&#8217;s character) said &#8220;I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,&#8221; I had no doubt about it. Make no mistake, Walt is as tough a character as Eastwood has every portrayed &#8211; perhaps the toughest &#8211; but there is more to Walt than tough and I believed that too. 

I was worried at the beginning of the film. The exposition of Eastwood&#8217;s character came off as a bit forced to me at first. Once I made my way past that (and one apparent moment of out-of-character behavior), I enjoyed this movie very much. I even cried a little the second time through. I do cry more easily at movies than most men, but not usually the second time I&#8217;ve seen one. I still consider myself as masculine as any man. I&#8217;m actually a pretty tough guy, though not nearly as tough as Walt &#8211; I&#8217;m sure of that.
