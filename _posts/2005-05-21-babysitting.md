Right now I&#8217;m sitting in the parking lot at Home Depot. The kids are watching a muppets DVD. Brian and Jennifer have to pick something out. There happens to be a wireless network in range here called &#8216;orange&#8217; and the key is &#8216;depot.&#8217; Interesting. I couldn&#8217;t obtain an IP addy though. I wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing anyway, so I&#8217;ll post this later.
