I saw a [nakedpastor drawing][np] a while back that reminded me of a couple of posts I wrote almost four years ago - [here][one] and [here][two].

I've been thinking about that a lot since I wrote them, and I've talked to a lot of people about those ideas. Some people have accused me of playing word games, but I really don't see it that way. If there is only one God, then we really all do come from the same one, right? Are we "woshipping" the same one? Well, that's really another story, but if you ask me, what label you give yourself doesn't really help answer that question.

In one of those posts, I mentioned something our pastor said about "the person in the pew next to you might not believe in the same God you do." The point he was making, I think, was that we get so hung up on what other people in "other religions" believe that we forget that none of us have it figured out. Even people who have the same label you do, might not really be worshiping the same God.

When you stop to think of it, most of us don't worship God at all. We worship our idea of God. That almost certainly is not the same thing.

I just wish we would all stop focusing on who has all the right answers. I can tell you who has all the right answers.

Nobody.
