This is the End is a ridiculous comedy with gratuitous crude humor throughout. The plot, though unbelievable in the extreme, was strong. The film featured six film and TV stars, with appearances by dozens more, all playing themselves. The self-mockery was genuinely funny. The relationship driven drama is excellent, and there was a lot of additional genuine character driven humor &#8211; most notably the conversations involving Jay Baruchel, The rest was crude, cheap laughs.

Best parts &#8211; Emma Watson almost upstages every other performance in one sceene, and the film ends pretty much the way you hope it does. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
