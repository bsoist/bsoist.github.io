I absolutely love it when someone who has been essentially written out of history finally has his story told. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R7FZ074/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00R7FZ074&linkCode=as2&tag=weifyoasme-20&linkId=WIP2LMTUH6SECMYD">The Imitation Game</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00R7FZ074" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> tells one of those stories. Joe Williams says it best in his review for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

<blockquote>
Many of the people reading this review are doing it on a computer. And all of them are reading it in English. Itâ€™s not much of stretch to say that you could credit both of those things to a man named Alan Turing.

It's a sad story, but one that needs to be told. The movie does an excellent job telling it in a way that both entertains and inspires. It's brilliantly paced and features superb performances. I've read that the film takes some liberties with the truth, but I thought it handles the technical bits in a way that is both faithful to the truth - and the math - yet easy for non-techies to follow. I found myself wondering on several occasions if potential misunderstandings would be explained. I was not disappointed.

As interesting as the technical details were, the more interesting - and more important - part of the story is of the man himself. We owe our way of life to this man in a way we can't really understand fully. From my limited perspective, the film does an excellent job helping us understand him and his struggles.
