I woke up in the mood to do some writing.
When I learned that <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/12118296/stuart-scott-espn-anchor-dies-age-49">Stuart Scott lost his battle to cancer</a>, I spent a lot of time putting my thoughts in writing. 
I'm sad and I'm spent. Can't put any more effort into writing today.
