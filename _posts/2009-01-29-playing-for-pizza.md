*Playing for Pizza* is a departure from Grisham&#8217;s normal fare, but it&#8217;s a fun story about a washed up NFL quarterback who heads to Italy to play for a team that even Italy doesn&#8217;t care about. 

Like most readers, I guess, I found the novel was missing a real story. I was enjoying the read but didn&#8217;t see what the point was. It actually reminded me for a while of my first reading of Hemingway. That was the experience then &#8211; I thought the story wandered around but I enjoyed reading about the characters. The one difference here, of course, is that Grisham&#8217;s characters in this one are not as interesting. 

I happened to read this book during the NFL season when my Jets were thriving with their new washed up quarterback, so I was captivated by the similarities in the experiences of the football teams. It actually gave me grand hope for my Jets &#8211; hope that dissipated soon after, I&#8217;m sorry to report.

If you are a Grisham fan, you may be disappointed. You won&#8217;t find the normal twist of plot you&#8217;ve learned to expect. If you are looking for a quick, relatively fun read then you should pick this one up.
