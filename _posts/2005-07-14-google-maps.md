Tell me this is not cool!The night it was announced my son and I began brainstorming what we should try. We came up with about two dozen ideas and decided I should try about 8 of them.Here are two maps I threw together as a learning experience. They are not finished yet, but it shouldn&#8217;t take much moreUPDATE: I forgot to post the links to the maps. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> [This one][1] actually works. It may not work well, but you can actually do searches. I have to click on one of the panel items to make the map show, but I am looking into that. [This one][2] is a mock up of the next one I&#8217;d like to finish. It doesn&#8217;t work yet. I plan to pull all the data and store in on my server.
