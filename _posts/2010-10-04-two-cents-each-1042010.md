[Does this loop ever end? (Scripting News)][1]
:   I could not agree more. Closed will never win.

[Church Marketing Sucks: Thou Shall Twitter in Church][2]
:   I don&#8217;t have a problem with Twittering in church as much as I do Twittering while in the company of others and while one should be listening and meditating. On the other hand, sharing something does help make it real. I would not be against using Twitter during church as long as I knew it wasn&#8217;t a distraction from why I am there &#8211; which could easily be the case I think.

[Conan O&#8217;Brien and Jack White Record Live Album &#8211; Spinner][3]
:   Who wouldn&#8217;t buy this?

[Seth&#8217;s Blog: Hourly work vs. linchpin work][4]
:   &#8220;That&#8217;s quite an hourly wage. It&#8217;s also quite a bargain.&#8221; Very well said.

[Rands In Repose: How to Write a Book][5]
:   Must read for anyone who would like to right a book.

[This is a news website article about a scientific finding][6]
:   This is one of the funniest things I&#8217;ve read in a long time. Bravo!

[Donâ€™t Listen To Stupid People][7]
:   Could not agree more!

[Youâ€™re Not an Entrepreneur][8]
:   &#8220;I do not think it means what you think it means.&#8221; Great stuff!
