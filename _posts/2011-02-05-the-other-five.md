Turns out I saw exactly half of the 2010 best picture nominations in 2010. I commented on those [over here][1]. Now I&#8217;ve seen the other half and I have just a few comments about each below.

Don&#8217;t forget to predict the Oscar winners for a chance to win a $100 gift card. [Make your picks now.][2]

## 127 Hours {#127_hours}

> It&#8217;s no slurpee!

[127 Hours][3]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0041KKYDI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is an agonizing, yet inspiring, look at a risk-taking adventurer who comes to grip with his love of family and his desire to &#8220;go it alone.&#8221; Franco turns in one of the finest performances of 2010.

## Black Swan {#black_swan}

> It was perfect.

[Black Swan][4]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0041KKYEM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a disturbing masterpiece that explores the pursuit of perfection. The imagery is fantastic &#8211; Aronofsky uses of mirrors, lookalikes, unusual rooms, and slow motion to spectacular effect.

## Winter&#8217;s Bone {#winter8217s_bone}

> I&#8217;m here huntin&#8217; dad.

[Winter&#8217;s Bone][5]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B003EYVXTG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is an aptly names film that tells a harsh story about hardened characters living in a harsh environment. Lawrence and Hawkes very much deserve their Oscar nominations. They were spectacular.

## True Grit {#true_grit}

> Where would I find this Rooster?

In [True Grit][6]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B003UESJME" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, I expected spectacular cinematography, brilliant dialogue, and an exceptional performance by Bridges. What I did not expect was an Oscar worthy performance from Hailee Steinfeld. She played the role perfectly!

## The Kids Are All Right {#the_kids_are_all_right}

> Right on!

Outstanding performances by Bening and Moore, yet Ruffalo walks away with the film. The film does explore some interesting questions relating to same sex marriage but it falls flat &#8211; a good film but not worthy of a best picture nomination in my opinion.
