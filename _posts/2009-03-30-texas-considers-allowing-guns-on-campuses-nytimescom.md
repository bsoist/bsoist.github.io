The NY Times [is reporting][1] that the state legislature in Texas is considering a bill which would allow properly licensed persons to carry concealed weapons on a college campus.

I hate guns myself but I firmly believe our right to carry them helps protect our freedom. I also believe that if more people carried concealed weapons there would be less violence &#8211; not more.

On the other hand, I tend to worry about weapons on a college campus. I have a lot of friends of college age and most are very responsible, but we all know that college is a time when students &#8220;let loose&#8221; a bit (or a lot). Concealed weapons may not be a great idea in this environment.

What do you think?
