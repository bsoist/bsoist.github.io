I mentioned earlier that I have been working on my linkblog. Here is a quick update on the goings on. First, I am grabbing my links from <a href="http://del.icio.us/bsoist/" rel="tag">del.icio.us</a> and posting them into a database for my [WordPress][1] powered [linkblog][2]. As I play with this, you may see links that don&#8217;t make sense, links that disappear and re-appear, etc. If you subscribe via RSS, you may see an ocassional refresh. I apologize for this. I will get it the way I want it soon. Second, my links come in topical waves. It just so happens that I pointed out my new linkblog to the world and then I started on a [project][3] that caused my linkblog to look like the ravings on an mlm junkie. I&#8217;m not. A wave more interesting to you may be coming soon. Thanks for listening.
