Anybody who knows me, even casually, probably knows that I am suspicious of athletes thanking God after a game. I liken it to taking God&#8217;s name in vain. In my opinion, some athletes just use Jesus as a good luck charm.

I don&#8217;t think Tim Tebow does.

Since Tebow started making waves as an NFL quarterback, I&#8217;ve noticed a disturbing trend &#8211; people using Tebow&#8217;s success on the football field as a sign that Jesus is blessing him. All good things, including winning football games, come from God, but it doesn&#8217;t follow that winning a game indicates God&#8217;s favor. This line of &#8220;reasoning&#8221; bothers me on several levels, most notably that it is easily disproven with a dash of rational thinking, but the danger is the obvious corollary &#8211; that failure is a sign of God&#8217;s disapproval. I&#8217;ve seen signs in recent years that fewer Christians &#8220;think&#8221; this way, but I&#8217;m afraid many Christians are swept up in Tebowmania.

I don&#8217;t think Tim Tebow is.

Yes, I&#8217;m a Christian. Yes, I&#8217;m a Gator. Yes, Tebow and I lived in the same neck of the woods for a while. Yes, I&#8217;ve been a fan for almost ten years. Yes, I&#8217;ve always rooted for the Broncos and Elway in games that didn&#8217;t negatively affect my Jets. I&#8217;m convinced, though, that I&#8217;m being objective.

Tim Tebow ***IS*** different!

Do I agree with everything he says because he&#8217;s a Christian? No. Will I root for him next week simply because he is a beliver? No (Ravens are a local team with an even &#8220;localer&#8221; hero, and my daughter is a Texans fan).

But he is different, and we need more athletes like him!
