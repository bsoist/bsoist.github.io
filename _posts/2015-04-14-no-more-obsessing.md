I am learning how to not obsess so much about things.

A few days ago, I read some of the [best blogging advice I have ever read][1] - and I've been blogging and reading advice about blogging for quite a long time.

The advice was - in a nutshell - do not obsess over the details. 

It is not even as though that was a new revelation for me. I knew this was a problem. I knew it was **my** problem. I just was't trying to fix it.

Starting today I am going to stop obsessing over it so much.
