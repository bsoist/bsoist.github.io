We watched[Two Weeks Notice][1] with[Sandra Bullock][2]and [Hugh Grant][3]last night.Â When I watch a romantic comedy (I admit &#8212; I usually enjoy them), I don&#8217;t really expect much comedy. The point is the love story, right? Of course there are exceptions to this rule, but in most cases my wife and I watch these movies together because we enjoy the predictable storylines and the &#8216;Awwwww&#8217; moments sprinkled throughout.If you like your romantic comedies to be genuinely funny, this movie is not for you. If you are interested in a feel-good love story (predictability aside), you should see this film. Sandra Bullock&#8217;s character is the same combination of cute and neurotic that her fans have grown to love, and Hugh Grant provides the little bit of comedy you will discover in this movie.
