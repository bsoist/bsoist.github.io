Went to see Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy last night with Brian. We were all at his place for a little birthday get-together for Terri (4/12) and Jennifer (4/28). I mentioned that we should see it and 25 minutes later we were in our seats with popcorn and soda. It was very funny. Brian had never read the book and he still found it funny. I thought they did a good job translating that kind of written humor to a film. If you&#8217;ve never read the book, you should. If you don&#8217;t know where to find the book, <a href="http://xml-na.amznxslt.com/onca/xml3?sort=+pmrank&f=http://bsoist.freeshell.org/amz/xsl/amz-detail.xsl&offer=All&dev-t=D1LEVL42QH5864&t=weifyoasme-20&type=heavy&page=1&mode=books&KeywordSearch=hitchhikers%20guide" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t Panic!</a>
