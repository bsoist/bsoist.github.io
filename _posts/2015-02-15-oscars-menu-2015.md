Every year the menu for the day of the Oscars includes food inspired by the best picture nominations.

This years menu is below.

## Breakfast

Egg in a hole - _The Theory of Everything_

This is what Terri's family used to call Egyptian eyes. You take a piece of bread, rip a whole in it, put in in a hot frying pan, and then crack an egg into the hole. From there you cook it up like you would an egg.

Eggs to represent creation and the whole to represent black holes.

## Lunch

Sandwhiches - _The Imitation Game_

## Dinner, Snacks, and Party Food

Pizza - _Whiplash_

Tortillas and Queso - _Boyhood_

Cold Cuts and Mustard - _Birdman_ - we found meatless bologna slices :)

## Dessert 

American Flag made of Jello and Whipped Cream - _American Sniper_

Cupcakes - _The Grand Budapest Hotel_

## Drinks

Coke - _Boyhood_

Tea - _The Theory of Everything_ and _The Imitation Game_

If you drink alcohol, you could add Beer for _The Theory of Everything_, and _Gin_ for _Birdman_.
