We could not wait to see this film. 

I was disappointed.

The only redeeming part of the film, if you ask me, were two excellent performances by McDormand and Rockwell. 

She was excellent. Worthy of the nomination, and perhaps a winning performance in some other year, but this year I think the other four were all as good or better.

Rockwell, on the other hand, turned in the performance of a lifetime. If he were not such a great actor, I would say he can't top this one. Even as good as he is, he may not be able to do better than this. He was absolutely amazing.

Woody Harrelson is a great actor, and a favorite of mine, but I just don't get his nomination for this performance at all.

It's certainly a great film, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype. [No spoilers though][spoil].
