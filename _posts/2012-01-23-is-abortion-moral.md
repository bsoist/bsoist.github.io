I know this might be hard reading for some, but I stumbled onto [this article][1] months ago. It&#8217;s well worth reading. The author presents a case for the morality of abortion by asking, and answering, six questions.

  1. Is it alive?
  2. Is it human?
  3. Is it a person?
  4. Is it physically independent?
  5. Does it have human rights?
  6. Is abortion murder?

It is certainly a solid case for the right to choose, but many will struggle with what they mightÂ perceiveÂ as a leap to calling it moral.

What does it mean for something to be moral?
