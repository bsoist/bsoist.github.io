Last week, I stumbled on [this fun site][1]. It&#8217;s a running list of numbers with an indication about what is special about that number.

Stuff like &#8230;

  * 2 is the only even prime
  * 6 is the smallest perfect number
  * 8 is the largest cube in the Fibonacci sequence

and just a few of my favorites from the first 100

  * 40 is the only number whose letters are in alphabetical order
  * 53 is the only two digit number that is reversed in hexadecimal
  * 67 is the smallest number which is palindromic in bases 5 and 6
  * 77 is the largest number that cannot be written as a sum of distinct numbers whose reciprocals sum to 1

The site is also full of links to fun and interesting math topics &#8211; if you find math fun and interesting.
