I posted a while back about [my hunt][1] to see many of the Oscar nominated films and I wanted to post an update. 

I saw [all of the shorts][2].

I also saw Man On Wire, In Bruges, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, The Visitor, Slumdog Millionaire, Frost/Nixon, and Benjamin Button. I enjoyed all of them. I thought Slumdog was fantastic and Button was much better than I expected. 

I tried Wanted but turned it off after a few minutes. It was clear it was not my kind of film. 

I have The Duchess and Frozen River at home and I am off to watch Frozen River now.
