I&#8217;ve been a Jets fan since the mid 70s and a Gators fan since the early 90s. I&#8217;ve also been a huge fan of Tim Tebow since he started with the Gators. I&#8217;ve followed his career and public work for years. Though I&#8217;m a huge fan, I&#8217;ve always thought he would be a worse than average NFL quarterback at best. Though I&#8217;m a fellow Christian, I have disagreed with Tebow on a few matters of faith and practice. 

Now Tebow has become a Jet and I am excited. Perhaps not as excited as he is ( see video below <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ), but I do think this is a good move for the Jets. I think Tebow may very well light a fire under Sanchez. I also think Tebow gives us the real option from time to time. The reason the option doesn&#8217;t work in pro football most of the time is that the QB running it is not a legitimate threat to pass. Tebow is. I know some of you are laughing. What I mean is that Tebow does pass. He may not pass well, but he does pass. 

## As a Jets fan &#8230;

I thought Peyton Manning would have been a better fit, but I agree with [this guy][1] &#8211; why complain about it? Why not let it ride and see what happens? 

## As a Christian &#8230;

I&#8217;m offended by articles like [this one][2]. The author is implying that Tim Tebow doesn&#8217;t belong in New York because he is a Christian.

## As a reasonable person &#8230;

I disagree with articles like [this one][3]. The author implies that Tebow doesn&#8217;t belong in New York because of his views on homosexuality. Tebow and I may not agree on this issue, but I certainly don&#8217;t agree that he doesn&#8217;t belong in New York City because of it.
