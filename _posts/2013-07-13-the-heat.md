> Cheese doesn&#8217;t go bad

I really enjoyed this film. I love [Sandra Bullock][1], and I&#8217;m starting to fall for McCarthy, but I was a little worried about the language and a bit too much cheap humor. No doubt, there was much of that, but the film was very entertaining, and very very funny.

It also featured two strong female characters doing more then just looking good and giving the men in the film what they want, and it touched on some interesting themes, including the meaning of family, friendship, loneliness, and what it means to do the right thing.

If you don&#8217;t mind the language &#8211; many times simply for the laughs &#8211; you should see the film.
