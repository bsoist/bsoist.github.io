Today is my birthday. Having a birthday on New Year&#8217;s Day has it&#8217;s benefits and disadvantages. 

I always think of my mom on my birthday. She always went to great lengths to make people take notice of my birthday and to make it a perfect day. 

She had this ridiculous tradition of wanting to see me or at least talk to me on the phone at exactly the time I was born. I used to try desperately to explain to her how silly that was, given that time is an arbitrary convention, etc. etc.

Well, today I wish I could share [this][1] with her.
