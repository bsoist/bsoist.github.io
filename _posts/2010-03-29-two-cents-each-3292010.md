[The Medium &#8211; Beep! &#8211; NYTimes.com][2]
:   A fun read about a great sound and a great word.

[Amazon: You Need To Change Your Idiotic Customer Reviews Policy Right Now][3]
:   I don&#039;t like that some authors withhold the Kindle version, but this is not the appropriate way to respond.

[Shut Up & Bring It | Talking Points Memo][4]
:   Yeah!

[Constitutionality of Mandatory Insurance][5]
:   The new health care reform signed into law is not unconstitutional. It might not be perfect, it might not even be good, but it&#039;s constitutional.
