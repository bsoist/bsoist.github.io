Today is read across America. I can't think of a better way to honor Dr. Seuss.

I love to [read][books] - and I love [books][tag]. I love "real" books. I love e-books. I love audiobooks.

The first gift I ever received from my dad was a book. I was the first born and I guess my dad didn't think about how useless a book might be to a newborn. My mom, as was her style sometimes, poked fun at my dad over that for about forty years. My brother was born almost four years later and my dad, having learned his lesson I guess, gave him a football. My brother likes to tell people those gifts turned out to be the reason one of us is so smart. This, of course, is nonsense. My brother and sister are both very smart. It's more reasonable to assume that whatever drove my dad to get me a book is what also fuels my love of books. 

When our son was born, Terri ( a book lover too ) and I made a commitment to share our love of reading with him. We read to him every night for years. We did the same for our daughter. They both learned to love reading - and learning. 

I have no doubt that reading is one of the single most important things anyone can do to improve the quality of their lives.
