I [love Google+][1] but there are a few things I am not enjoying. The order of this list may not accurately reflect my hatred or annoyance level. I know some of these things will change so I&#8217;ve factored that into the order.

## 10. Not Enough Friends Using It {#10_not_enough_friends_using_it}

Yes, I can share via email but I can&#8217;t wait until more of my friends and family use it. Or can I?

## 9. No Vanity URL {#9_no_vanity_url}

Why can&#8217;t I have http://plus.google.com/bsoist instead of <http://plus.google.com/105464499358582882628>? I can use http://plus.google.com/me but that only works for me. 

## 8. Too Much Talk About Google+ {#8_too_much_talk_about_google}

I like talking about Google+ but I&#8217;d like to talk more about other things too &#8211; like baseball, economics, and politics. More of my &#8220;real life&#8221; friends on board will help.

## 7. Makes Chrome Unresponsive {#7_makes_chrome_unresponsive}

Probably just a Chrome thing (which is ironic, isn&#8217;t it?) but annoying anyway. I am planning to try other browsers today.

## 6. No Nested Circles {#6_no_nested_circles}

I want to put circles inside of circles. I know I will regret doing it but that&#8217;s not the point. Let me try.

## 5. Reading Circles is Limited {#5_reading_circles_is_limited}

Nested circles might solve this but I would prefer the ability to read my stream minus one or two circles. I was *shocked* to learn they didn&#8217;t work that way. I assumed those little circles next to the names of the circles were radio buttons. 

## 4. No Search? {#4_no_search}

I know I can search Google+ posts using Google but why it is not built right into the UI is perplexing. I guess I can think of a reason or two they would purposely leave it out but they can&#8217;t go on like this. Isn&#8217;t search what people do?

## 3. Mobile Limitations {#3_mobile_limitations}

I still can&#8217;t re-share or +1 a comment on mobile. Why?

## 2. the @#%$&! Scrolling! {#2_the_scrolling}

I desperately need Google to add some kind of aggregation of content or a pause button for live updating. I constantly have it scroll on me while trying to read or comment. It is a @#%$&! pain.

## 1. Too Many Animated GIFs {#1_too_many_animated_gifs}
