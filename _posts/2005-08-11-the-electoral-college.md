I&#8217;ve always been a supporter of the electoral college. Probably because I understand the founders&#8217; intent. Maybe it, like other good ideas, is no longer a useful thing. Perhaps it does more damage than good. For 16 of the 21 years I&#8217;ve been voting age, I&#8217;ve lived in states where I felt as though my vote would not count one bit. That&#8217;s not right, is it? This is one of those topics I would love to post more about, but probably won&#8217;t. [Chris Bowers][1] and [Ruy Teixeira][2] provide some good analysis of a [study on the subject][3]. See also Chris&#8217; interesting [partisan index chart][4].
