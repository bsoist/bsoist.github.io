I realized earlier today that I have never written anything here about Minecraft.

I was very late to the Minecraft party. I knew about it from the very beginning, but I didn't start playing until about 18 months ago. I remember seeing one of my nieces play on her tablet a long time ago, but I didn't really get it. It wasn't until some time later that I decided to try it. I kept hearing teachers talk about using it in the classroom. Some even talked about letting student turn in "Minecraft worlds" as assessments. So, I figured I should at least see what all the talk was about.

After playing just a few times, I was completely hooked.
