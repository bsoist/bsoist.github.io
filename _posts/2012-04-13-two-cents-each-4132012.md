[Detox // ShaunInman.com][1]
:   &#34;Stats are cool and all but only when they donâ€™t break the experience for your users.&#34; &#8211; AGREED!

[Political Animal &#8211; Why People Go To Law School][2]
:   Agreed. Too many students choose a path based on the wrong way to reach goals they don't really want to achieve anyway.

[Why the Church has a Shortage of Leaders : What's Best Next][3]
:   I agree that we must recover the doctrine of vocation. The church is too pre-occupied with itself and its subculture.

[The Evangelical Rejection of Reason &#8211; NYTimes.com][4]
:   Many Christians were really upset when this article was published. I know many of them see the logic as circular, but that is simply because they are afraid of what science will teach them. I have issues with Dobson, but I wouldn't put him in the same camp as Ken Ham or David Barton. Otherwise, I agree with this article entirely.

['A Test You Need to Fail': A Teacher's Open Letter to Her 8th Grade Students | Common Dreams][5]
:   Excellent! We are absolutely testing for the wrong things. Student are taught to play a game, to fill in the circles, to meet all the requirements. Doing original, creative work is not rewarded.

[Reply to comment &#8211; National Review Online][6]
:   Mr. Sowell,  
    You should be ashamed of yourself on two counts.</p> 
    
    1. Agreeing with Geraldo Rivera. It may very well be good advice to not wear a hoodie, but Rivera's comment was that the hoodie was just as much at fault as the shooter. Even if the shooter is proven innocent, one can't blame the incident on the hoodie, and no matter how solid the advice, now is not the time to give it.
    
    2. Linkbait &#8211; you pull the reader in with a title about the hoodie and a few paragraphs about how you agree with Rivera, but the remainder of the article is about something else entirely. </dd> 
    
    [Mitt Romney canâ€™t shake away impressions heâ€™s made &#8211; The Washington Post][7]
    :   &#34;In an attempt to foreclose even the remote possibility of a contested convention, the Romney campaign has been trotting out a bevy of prominent Republicans to announce their support. But is it just me, or do these endorsements have all the enthusiasm of a series of hostage tapes?&#34;</p>

        [Daydreaming like a Missionary | Ordinary Pastor][8]
        :   &#34;In other words day dreaming is often musings upon what it would be like if God were not God and I was.&#34;</p> 
            
            I never really thought about daydreaming like this, but I guess that's what it is &#8211; mostly.</dd> 
            
            [Seth's Blog: When execution gets cheaper, so should planning][9]
            :   &#34;The goal should be to have the minimum number of meetings and scenarios and documentation necessary to maximize the value of execution.&#34;</p> 
                
                Some of the best advice I've ever heard &#8211; period.</dd> 
                
                [A VC: Finding Your Voice][10]
                :   Absolutely! It's a real joy to see people find what matters to them and act on it.</dl>
