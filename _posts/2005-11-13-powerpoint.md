A few years ago, while on a plane to Seattle, my neighbor was reading an article in Wired magazine entitled &#8220;PowerPoint Is Evil.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help notice the title and once he finished with the magazine, I sttuck up a conversation with him about the article. It was an interesting discussion and my new friend let me walk away with the magazine. I am sure I sitll have it with the rest of my <del>junk</del> stuff somewhere which is very foolish considering I can read [it][1] anytime I&#8217;d like online.I was reminded of this recently when I heard about the role PowerPoint may have played in space shuttle disaster.  


> &#8220;It is easy to understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening situation,&#8221; the Columbia Accident Investigation Board concluded, citing Tufte&#8217;s work. The board devoted a full page of its 2003 report to the issue, criticizing a space agency culture in which, it said, &#8220;the endemic use of PowerPoint&#8221; substituted for rigorous technical analysis.<cite><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/29/AR2005082901444.html">PowerPoint: The Killer App?</a></cite></p>
I am very sorry that people may have had to die to bring this to light, but I am glad that somebody is saying what needs to be said about this software.  


> Perhaps I&#8217;ve sat through too many PowerPoint presentations lately, but I think the trouble with these critics is that they don&#8217;t go far enough: The software may be as much of a mind-numbing menace to those of us who intend to remain earthbound as it is to astronauts.<cite><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/29/AR2005082901444.html">PowerPoint: The Killer App?</a></cite></p>
While checking for more info about this post, I learned that perhaps using slides to prepare a speech or presentation is not all bad. [This article][2] gives tips on good and bad use of PowerPoint for lawyers, and [this one][3], while not about PowerPoint, explains how &#8216;picturing&#8217; your speech can help give it focus. It&#8217;s an old piece, but still worth reading in my opinion. I also ran into a great story about a man who was upset because, though his presentation was a success, [he didn&#8217;t get to show his slides][4].To make this whole episode even more rewarding, I found quite a bit of info about some[ideas][5] about [replacing PowerPoint][6]. Keep in mind that [these][7] [alternatives][8] still present some of the same problems. According to Edward Tufte (the author of the Wired article), the problem is the culture of the sales pitch.
