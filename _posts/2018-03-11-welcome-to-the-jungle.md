Only had time for one movie this weekend and we had to make it fit within a tight window, so we saw a movie we weren't relaly stoked about - _Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_. We both love The Rock, have enjoyed his other films, and we laughed hysterically at _Central Intelligence_ which also featured Kevin Hart. So we knew we'd laugh but we weren't sure of much else. 

We also really liked the original, so now I wonder why this wasn't higher on our list.

Anyway, <!--more-->it was a fun movie that turned out to be much better than we expected. I assume it's pretty hard to pull of a sequel twenty years after the original and if you ask me, this one succeeds. There was enough silliness to keep everyone shaking heads, plenty of well-done humor, feel good vibes, and a not-too-preachy message about friendship. The action scenes and scenery might make it worth a visit to the big screen, but it's probably safe to save it for home viewing.
