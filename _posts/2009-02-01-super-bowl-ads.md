Super Bowl Sunday is the one day when many people look forward as much to the advertisements as to the game itself. The last few years have been a letdown in my opinion, but there have been some great ones. You can see a collection of them at [superbowl-ads.com][1]. 

The first great commercial I remember was the Mac commercial [&#8220;1984&#8243;][2]. We don&#8217;t consider the Skins disgrace an &#8220;afterthought&#8221; but the ad did help ease the pain. 

There have been some good ones since. The Budweiser horses playing football, the Budweiser dalmations, and the e-Trade baby to name a few.

I am looking forward to [the baby&#8217;s return this year][3].
