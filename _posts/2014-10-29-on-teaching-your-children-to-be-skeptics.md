Yesterday a tweet caught my attention.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>This morning, our daughter demanded handwriting samples.&#10;&#10;Then, compared them to her note from the tooth fairy.&#10;&#10;With a MAGNIFYING GLASS.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/527167951321829376">October 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

It probably goes without saying, but I just love the idea of a child trying to dispel the myth of the tooth fairy.

My first thought was something similar to what was expressed in a reply to the original tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">@hotdogsladies</a> Amazing! And the only validation you need that you are absolutely killing it at the parenting game!</p>&mdash; Mike Swimm (@mikeswimm) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeswimm/status/527171902172041216">October 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

I'm not sure exactly what @mikeswimm meant by his tweet, but I agree this girl's behavior is a sign of doing something right as parents. 

If you ask me, we all need to do a better job teaching our kids to be skeptics. Any kid who is challenging what she knows and what she has been told is on the right track. No question about it.
