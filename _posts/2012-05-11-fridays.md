I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about changing things up around here.

One new change I wrote about earlier in the week is posting weekly about the intersection of and potential conflict between science and faith.

Another thing I thought I would do is change up what I do on Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays. For quite a while I&#8217;ve not actually written anything on those days, but I&#8217;ve occasionally posted a collection of those links. I still plan to post those (well, at least my &#8220;two cents each&#8221; links), but I&#8217;m not going to reserve certain days for it.

So, I was looking for something on the lighter side to do on Fridays &#8211; family of fun. I&#8217;ve decided on several possibilities and I think I&#8217;ll switch between them from time to time.

Today, let&#8217;s do a little of each.

## Family Fridays

I&#8217;m headed to NYU tomorrow to help Billy pack up his things and bring him back home for the summer. He is headed to Germany in June for a couple of weeks, and Becky has a couple of trips planned to. We&#8217;re looking forward to a good summer.

## Flushing Fridays

How &#8217;bout them Mets! We swept the sillies for the first time since 2006, and we are the winningest team in NY right now.

## Football Fridays

Still looking forward to a great season for Gang Green. J! &#8211; E! &#8211; T! &#8211; S! Jets! Jets! Jets!

## Hair Metal Fridays
