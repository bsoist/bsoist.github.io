I have just decided to switch from Blosxom to pyBlosxom. Mostly because I use Python in my classes. I like Perl a lot and I really like Blosxom, but I wanted to try this. Frankly, I did not think it would be this easy. In my experience, any Perl script I grabbed from the web has always worked more &#8216;forgivingly&#8217; than any Python script. Now I just have to find (or write) the right plugins. I will not be moving old posts here.
