Whenever I write a movie review I have the urge to explain why the reviews are so short and lacking in plot details.

Since I've [decided][love] to post reviews more than once a week, I thought I should just write and post this explanation once.

I like to write movie reviews that contain as few spoilers as possible. I realize that may be irrational in a world where we talk about everything via social media, etc, but I don't want to be the one that spoils a movie for anyone.

I like to share my favorite quotes from a movie, and sometimes I even have to hold back on those because it spoils too much.

Which means most of my reviews are relatively short - some of them very short.
