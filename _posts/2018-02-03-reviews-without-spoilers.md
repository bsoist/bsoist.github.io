I like to write movie reviews that contain as few spoilers as possible. I realize that may be irrational in a world where we talk about everything via social media, etc, but I don't want to be the one that spoils a movie for anyone.

I like to share my favorite quotes from a movie, and sometimes I even have to hold back on those because it spoils too much.

Which means most of my reviews are relatively short - some of them very short.
