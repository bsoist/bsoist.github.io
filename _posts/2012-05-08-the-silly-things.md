My life has been shaped by many great and important things &#8211; my parents, my siblings, my wife, my kids, my high school economics teacher, the Bible and other great books, etc, but more often than not, the most dramatic **positive** changes to my attitude and behavior have come from the silliest of things. Things that might seem insignificant to others. In some cases, even things I detest.

I thought it might be interesting to write about some of these things in the coming weeks. 

So, let&#8217;s start with a list. 

  * Twitter
  * Amway
  * My Bike
  * Star Wars
  * KickStarter
  * The Walkman
  * Video Games
  * Seinfeld (TV)
  * The Game of Risk
  * The New York Mets
  * The Apprentice (the TV show)
  * The Clash, U2, and The Police

What are some of the silly things that have changed you?
