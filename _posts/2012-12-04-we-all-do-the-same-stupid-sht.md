I think I&#8217;m a pretty smart guy. My mom always said so.

Seriously, people think I&#8217;m smart. I had a friend in college who used to introduce me as the smartest person she ever met, and people are always saying things like &#8220;you&#8217;re a genius&#8221; so, naturally, I started to think my mother was right ( I \*am\* special ).

The truth is, maybe I&#8217;m not so smart.

I think it was Dennis Miller who I first heard say &#8220;we all do the same stupid sh*t.&#8221;

The other day I was going to use the toaster, and I grabbed it like this.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5711" title="toaster" src="http://media.soistmann.com/oped/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/toaster-300x225.jpg" alt="my hand in a toaster" width="300" height="225" />

I knew my daughter had just pulled something out of it. I knew it was hot.

So there you go.
