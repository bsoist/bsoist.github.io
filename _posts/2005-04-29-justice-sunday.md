When I heard about &#8220;Justice Sunday&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know what to think. Frankly I am tired of talking about this whole issue. I wish I could get more Christians to understand my point of view. If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog since the old days, you no doubt have read more than one post on faith in politics. I lost all of the posts from my old blosxom blog, but I still have some from the Blogger days. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll move them over. While I am just too tired to put my thoughts on this matter into writing one more time, I wanted to post a link to [this article][1] by Jim Wallis. I don&#8217;t agree with Wallis on every issue, but I think he&#8217;s right on with this.  

>I have no objection to Christian leaders expressing their faith in the public arena &#8211; it's a good thing that I do all the time. The question is not whether to do so, but how. As I heard more and more about "Justice Sunday," it felt to me like it was crossing an important line &#8211; saying that a political issue was a test of faith.

Couldn't agree more, Jim!
