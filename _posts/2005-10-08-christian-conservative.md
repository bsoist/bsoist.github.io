Late in July, I caught [this post][1] at Christian Conservative. My first reaction was anger. I thought it was inappropriate and very much out of context. My plan was to re-read and thoughfully mark it up with comments, but when I returned to it I was upset once again. Now that I return to my blog after a brief vacation, I would like to get this finished. Problem is &#8211; I no longer feel like expending the effort. I read through it again, but all I have to say is the obvious. President Truman&#8217;s comments were not in reference to our current war and I find it disrespectful to presume what Truman would say about this &#8216;war.&#8217; One of the comments to this post is worth quoting too:  


> For now, I&#8217;ll just point out that Harry Truman was the originator of the phrase &#8220;The Buck stops here.&#8221;So there&#8217;s no way I see him allowing people as genuinely and arrogantly incompetent as Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, et al, bungle something as important as managing a conquered country.&#8211; [jim b][2]

BTW, does anyone else think that asking if Truman would approve of dropping bombs is begging the question.
