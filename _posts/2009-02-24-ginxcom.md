I signed up for ginx.com yesterday and I enjoyed checking it out.

There are at least three things I like.

  1. Links are expanded and titles are displayed  
      
    As a [bit.ly][1] user I&#8217;d prefer people click on the shortened link but I know there is nothing I can do to have control over that and it&#8217;s only a preference.
    
    As a user, I love to be able to see the real link before clicking. I tend to agree with [Dave Winer][2] that this is easy to do and Twitter will certainly add this. At the very least, Twitter clients will add this feature.
    
    I&#8217;ve also noticed that not all links are expanded &#8211; [screen shot][3].

  2. It keeps track of the links I&#8217;ve clicked  
      
    I never really thought of having this as part of the Twitter experience but several times I&#8217;ve used [search.twitter.com][4] to find a link I&#8217;d opened. In most cases I did this so I could remember who posted the link, which brings me to what is by far my favorite feature.

  3. It gives me an easy way to reply or retweet after I&#8217;ve read the page linked to  
      
    I love this feature.
    
    Frequently, I click on links in tweets and I want to review the content later. Until now, If I wanted to @reply on the content I would have to go back and find the original post using [search.twitter.com][4] as noted above. Now I have a much better option. The links open a framed page with information in the top frame about the user who posted the link and an easy way to reply, dm, or retweet after I&#8217;ve read the page ([screen shot][5]).
