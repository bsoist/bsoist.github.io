Yesterday was dad's birthday. Mom decided the kids should do something special in memory of him. We all got some flower seeds to sprinkle in the yard or garden. We also got some helium balloons to &#8216;release.&#8217; It was very nice. We all arranged to do it at about the same time since we could not all be together. Becky drew a smiley face and wrote &#8220;Happy Birthday Pop-Pop&#8221; on one of her balloons (and one of Billy's). She said that would let PopPop know that we were saying &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221;I miss you very much, Dad. We all do!
