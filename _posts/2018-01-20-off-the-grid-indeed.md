You could have almost predicted it. I wrote about going off the grid and then I stopped blogging for a week. 

I just happened to miss my writing the next day, then I didn't post anything here. I was bummed that I had missed a day - my first in 2018 - but then I thought "no big deal, it's one day." The next day, I missed again! Then I thought I'd just get back to it on Tuesday, after the Monday holiday.

The next day, I almost missed my writing again (I've been not feeling well and sleeping in later) but I did it later in the evening. So I thought for the next ten days I would write late at night and get my _The Night Bat_ badge.

It is obvious to me again why I prefer writing in the morning. 

Hopefully, I can stick to it again.
