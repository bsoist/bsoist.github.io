Lady Bird is a fun film centered around difficult themes - family and growing up.

My daughter saw it at the premeire in LA promised it would be one of our favorite movies from last year. I am still working through my list, but she is right. It will certainly be among my favorites.

She really wanted to see it with us, but we were unable to go the first time we planned it. That actually led to some tension in the family that night, an irony that wasn't lost on my daughter or on me after I saw the film. We say goodbye to my daughter for her second quarter of college tomorrow, so the film really hit home with us.

Highly recommended.
