I didn&#8217;t post about it yesterday, but I did fund another project at Kickstarter &#8211; [Gravity &#8211; The new recording from Moors and McCumber][1].

James Moors and Kort McCumber are a songwriting and performing duo from Wisconsin and Colorado. They seemed like decent enough guys who care about the music they create, so I wanted to be a part.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
