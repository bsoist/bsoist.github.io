I see a lot of films. If you know me or have read more than a few posts from this blog, you already know that.

I typically try to save my &#8220;movie talk&#8221; for Saturday, but last night Terri and I serendipitously caught a film that I thought was worth mentioning in light of yesterday&#8217;s post.

Becky had some friends over for a Les Mis sing-along, so Terri and I decided to just see what movie we could catch on &#8220;real live TV&#8221; &#8211; something we very rarely do. We found [Collateral][1]. I haven&#8217;t [Flickcharted][2] it yet, but I suspect it&#8217;s not one of the best films I&#8217;ve ever seen. 

It was, however, much better than I expected, and it confirmed yet again some of the lessons I&#8217;ve been learning lately.
