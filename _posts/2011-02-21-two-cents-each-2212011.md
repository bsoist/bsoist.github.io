[Tussling Over Jesus &#8211; NYTimes.com][1]
:   As I've said many times before, the issues surrounding abortion are more complicated than many would admit (especially those against choice). I understand the church's desire to distance itself from abortion but I don't think pulling support for a hospital is the right way to make a statement. Cutting themselves out doesn't seem like the right play.Â 

[When Childrenâ€™s Art Takes Over the Home &#8211; NYTimes.com][2]
:   My children are brilliant, but I'd be doing them a disservice if I told them every picture they ever drew was worthy of framing.Â 

[Revolutionary Arab Geeks &#8211; NYTimes.com][3]
:   Â I'll have to read this book. The timing is ironic. A week ago I might have agreed with some of the author's ideas &#8211; I still tend to think he is on to something.

[Groupon Super Bowl Ads Â« Groublogpon â€“ The Serious Blog of Groupon][4]
:   The ads were in poor taste if you ask me. A funny idea, perhaps, but not executed properly.

[Lawmaker Says Most Want to Disband Ethics Office][5]
:   Surprise, surprise!

[Marginal Revolution: A License to Kill Shampoo][6]
:   A hilarious look at licensing in America.Â 

[Patterico&#8217;s Pontifications Â» Yes, Car Companies That Take Government Loans Should Advertise][7]
