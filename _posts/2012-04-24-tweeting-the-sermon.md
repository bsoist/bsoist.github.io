Today I stumbled onto [&#8220;Don&#8217;t Tweet that Sermon!&#8221; by Tim Challies][1]. I have to admit that when I first read the title I thought &#8220;yawn, we&#8217;ve discussed this before&#8221; but the discussion in the comments turned out to be very thought provoking.

I do want to comment briefly on all of his points, but first I want to point out what this tells me about the power of blogging. Though Tim is a gifted a thinker and writer, the real impact of his blog comes from the engagement around his thoughts. I am not taking credit away from him at all &#8211; quite the opposite. He was the one to realize that starting this conversation on **his** blog so that **his** readers could contribute, was a smart move indeed. It doesn&#8217;t matter that others have weighed in on this. It doesn&#8217;t matter that Tim himself might have covered some of this before (I&#8217;m not sure he has). The point is that we can all learn something from the discussion about it.

## Tweeting suggests that the sermon is as much for the global church as the local church.

There was quite a bit of discussion in the comments about this one and a call for Tim to explain what he meant exactly. I can&#8217;t pretend to know what he was thinking entirely, but I know why I tend to agree with this point &#8211; so I&#8217;ll explain that. I am a big fan of the Internet and the larger communities that introduces for us, but I am also a big believer in local church (and the local community in other areas). My pastor discerns a word from God for my local church (not God inspired &#8211; actually working on a post about that too). My responsibility is to listen to that word. If I&#8217;m listening to some other pastors message, I might miss &#8220;mine.&#8221; In order to respect that dynamic, I need to seriously question whether it is smart to tweet my message out to others &#8211; especially during the sermon.

Several commenters have asked about how this principal relates to sermon podcasts? Good question, and it leads nicely to where I disagree with this point. While a sermon might be intended for the local church, it certainly will contain truths applicable to the universal one, at least it should.

## Tweeting changes your focus from yourself to others.

This is the biggest point, by far, in my opinion. As a matter of fact, this is a major problem with social media in general. We become journalists who simply report the events around them instead of simply learning from them, engaging in them, and/or learning from them. At least one comment points out that social media didn&#8217;t create this problem &#8211; &#8220;my neighbor should hear this sermon&#8221; &#8211; but it certainly adds to the temptation. This is exactly why I don&#8217;t tweet sermons, even though I have been documenting the events of my life and my thoughts on things on and off for more than fifteen years.

## Tweeting reduces a sermon to itâ€™s tweetability.

A real danger, to be sure, but I see both sides to this issue. Reducing an idea to 140 characters can be a good exercise to help crystalize an idea.

## Tweeting is two-way.

There are several issues at play here &#8230;

  1. Discussion of the sermon with others &#8211; a very good thing in my opinion.
  2. Discussion of the sermon with others DURING the sermon &#8211; not a good thing.
  3. Discussion of other things. This is the reason I only open my email twice a day &#8211; there are a lot of distractions in there.

## Tweeting distracts people around you.

I&#8217;ve always been concerned about this, but the reality is that people learn to live with distractions. I&#8217;ve attended churches where children making noise were just the norm. At first it bothers people, but most people learn to adjust to that as part of that community. I have no problem with an environment where we trust our fellow congregants to engage in tweeting or whatever and not be distracted by it.
