> This is the worst!

I had high hopes for this film, and it did not disappoint.

I happened to see this the day after [Man of Steel][1], and I was struck by a couple of oddball similarities. The kind of thing I might have noticed if I hadn&#8217;t seen them so close together. Both include terraforming and colonizing planets. Both contained a whole lot of CGI generated action violence.

The difference in the violence is that I was expecting it when I walked into the theater for Pacific Rim, it was done well, and I thoroughly enjoyed almost all of it. It was also devoid of the gratuitous 9/11 imagery I saw in Man of Steel.

The science fiction in the film is a little goofy for my tastes, and some of the character motivations were cliche, but the perfomances were good, and there was quite a bit of humor I didn&#8217;t really expect.
