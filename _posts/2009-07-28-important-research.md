In the last week I&#8217;ve heard of two studies and I&#8217;m confused. Not because I don&#8217;t understand but because I&#8217;m certain we did not need a study to discover these things.

First, [Researchers have found that video games, TV and YouTube have helped popularize risky behaviors][1].

Second, [Researchers have found that men like to look at thin, confident, seductive women][2].

Really?
