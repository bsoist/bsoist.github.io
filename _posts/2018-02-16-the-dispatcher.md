> I f--king died today!

I went on an Audible binge about a week ago to start finishing books I'd already started. Naturally, I started with the shortest ones. :)

The second one I finished, on Monday, I think, <!--more--> was The Dispather, by John Scalzi, narrated by Zachary Quinto. It was a fun, short listen and I enjoyed it very much. It was based on an interesting premise and the narration by Quinto was fantastic. 

Highyly recommended - and it's today's Daily Deal on Audible if you want to pick it up for 99 cents. :)
