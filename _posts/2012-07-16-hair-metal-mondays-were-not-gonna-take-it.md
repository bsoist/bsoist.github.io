&#8220;We&#8217;re Not Gonna Take It&#8221; is a 1984 hit song by the American glam metal/heavy metal band Twisted Sister from their album Stay Hungry. I was never a huge fan of Twisted Sister, but they&#8217;ve recorded some decent work and this song is a classic from the 80s to be sure. I remember the video was a big hit. I don&#8217;t particularly care for it, but since a lot of people do I thought I&#8217;d use it here.

<pre>We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

We've got the right to choose and
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight a 1000 legions
Don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

Oh you're so condescending
Your goal is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do

Whoa...
Whoa...
We're right/yeah
We're free/yeah
We'll fight/yeah
You'll see/yeah

Oh we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh we're not gonna take it anymore

Oh we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh we're not gonna take it anymore
No way!

Whoa...
Whoa...
We're right/yeah
We're free/yeah
We'll fight/yeah
You'll see/yeah

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

We're not gonna take it, no!
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

Just you try and make us
We're not gonna take it
Come on
No, we ain't gonna take it
You're all worthless and weak
We're not gonna take it anymore
Now drop and give me twenty
We're not gonna take it
A Pledge pin
No, we ain't gonna take it
On your uniform
We're not gonna take it anymore
</pre>
