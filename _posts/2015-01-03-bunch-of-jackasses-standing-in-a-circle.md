I've seen it three times now and I can't get enough. Becky and I saw it in the theater and we couldn't wait to take Terri to see it. She loves super heroes much more than I but she didn't think she'd like it. She left the theater proclaiming it one of her favorite movies of all time - as I had done when I left the first viewing. Billy purchased the Blu-ray for her for Christmas and we watched it last week again.
It provides a solid mix of real humor, cheap humor ( but little crude ), and sentimentality. Full of puns and fun dialog. Even in the casting of Vin Diesel, and the promotion of his role, sets the tone for the film - it's one big joke, and I mean that as a real compliment.
Both "plan making" scenes are absolute classics. They combine great performances with perfect timing - you will not be disappointed.
All of the performances are solid, but the biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista. His performance as the metaphorically challenged Drax the Destroyer was flawless. The "nothing goes over my head" scene still makes me laugh out loud when I think about it.
The only thing parents should know is that this movie is violent throughout. I know of children younger than six who have seen it, but I can't imagine my children having seen it at that age. At both theater viewings, we saw young children carried out crying and screaming. Every child has a different tolerance for this, but I have to believe it would scare most children.
Otherwise, it's a marvelous film.
