First of all, I loved this movie. I had not read the book and I fully expected it to have an ending that strayed from the typical &#8220;feel good&#8221; Hollywood movie. I&#8217;m okay with that &#8211; I don&#8217;t particularly care for &#8220;everything turns out in the end&#8221; films.Â 

I loved the movie from the beginning. I felt it was a lock for Sound Mixing, Film Editing, andÂ Cinematography. Those are actually the three categories I am best qualified to vote on &#8211; in that order. I also assumed it should win for Directing and Writing &#8211; two things I know a little bit about.Â 

I also loved the music. I raved about it so much that my wife made it her pick for original score and song even though she had not seen the movie. I picked it for those as well.

Just a couple of days before the Oscars I read a piece that had a gripe about the film and I would like to hear your thoughts. I found the piece via SteveSilver.net -Â <http://bit.ly/u4OtI>
