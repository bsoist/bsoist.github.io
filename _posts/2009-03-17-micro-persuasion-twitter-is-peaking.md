[Steve Rubel][1] thinks Twitter is peaking and I agree with him. When I signed up in 2006 I did not update a lot but I loved following lots of my favorite geeks. I still enjoy Twitter but it seems like more work now and there is too much noise.

> In the last six months, Twitter has gone nuclear. There are three reasons why and I explore them in this post. However, they also point to why Twitter is about to jump the shark and we should begin asking ourselves what&#8217;s &#8220;the next big thing.&#8221;
