Got an email form Kickstarter yesterday telling me that someone was &#8220;following&#8221; me. Turns out it&#8217;s a new feature.

So, today I decided to back a project which my solitary follower was backing or watching.Â TheÂ project I chose is [Stop the Bleeding][1], a comedy webseries designed to help the hemophiliac community.

From the project page &#8230;

What is Stop The Bleeding!? It&#8217;s a comedic webseries centered around a proactive hemophiliac determined to improve the lives of those in the bleeding disorder community through an endless series of ill-conceived & poorly executed endeavors. Â He&#8217;s well-intended and incredibly ambitious&#8230;if only he knew what he was doing. Â Think: Michael Scott in The Office.



See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2] and my backing history [over here][3].
