I am absolutely sick over the news of the suicide of Aaron Swartz.

He may have made different choices than many of us would have made, but that&#8217;s exactly what made him so special. He was a real freedom fighter and he will be missed deeply.

Others have written more eloquently about this tremendous loss.

I found [this post][1] particularly moving. It doesn&#8217;t explicitly mention Aaron&#8217;s death, but it couldn&#8217;t be more timely ( and I acquired the author&#8217;s permission before sharing it in this context ).

Lawrence Lessig and Philip Greenspun, who each spent some time collaborating with Aaron, share a little bit with us [here][2] and [here][3].

The family has set up and official memorial site where you can contribute code, memory, and donations [over here][4].
