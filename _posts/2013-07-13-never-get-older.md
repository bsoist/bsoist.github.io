> I really hate that chicken

I mentioned in [another review today][1] that I am a sucker for father/children stories, and this is no exception.

Like most sequals to films aimed at children, it feels like a rundown of all the same jokes in another movie, but it was fun, and I had a good time watching it.

I certainly think they should stop while they&#8217;re ahead. Perhaps a spin-off minion film, or TV series, would be a riot.
