Now that I have that out, I did enjoy the panel on Meet the Press. I thought Jim Wallis hit home with his <q>not getting to solving problems</q>. Al Sharpton, with whom I have several disagreements, also made a strong case for voting based on other values; not just abortion and homosexuality.Â I have less positive to say about the other two. Dr. Falwell, despite his other shorcomings, did make clear that his ministries do more than just talk &#8212; they do.Â I was also glad to see Tim Russert having such a good time. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Â
