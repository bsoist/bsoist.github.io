It&#8217;s been a long time since my last HMM post. I had one planned for today, and I almost cancelled it because today is my 24th wedding anniversary. But then I thought this was a great memory of my fun-loving bride.

Recently I was watching clips from the 2012 M3 festival, and it reminded me of some of my favorite Styper tunes. Two of them &#8211; *Free* and *Calling on You* &#8211; used to show up every week when I was frequenting Hair Metal Fridays on turntable.fm (and I wasn&#8217;t the only one playing them) &#8211; so I&#8217;ve been listening to them more lately.

The other day we were playing Free in the car and Terri told Becky an old story she has told the kids before about how her and my sister, their aunt Barb, used to drive all over campus in my little Nissan Sentra blasting Stryper, along with a few other favorite hair bands, on the cassette deck.

I know there are some who have other favorites, but if you ask me Free is one of their best. I may not believe in free will <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> but I like the song a lot &#8211; and we humans behave as though we have free will, so maybe there is not much difference actually.

Anyway, enjoy this week&#8217;s pick &#8230;

<pre>Free to turn away say goodbye
Free to walk away and deny
The gift waiting for you
Whispers a still small voice, it's your choice

You're free, free to do what you want to
Choose your own destiny
Free to do what you want to

Free to open up and believe
Free to only ask and receive
There's no better time than now
'Cause you've got the right
To choose, you can't lose

You're free, free to do what you want to
Choose your own destiny
Free to do what you want to

Free, free to do what you want to
Choose your own destiny
Free to do what you want to

Free, free to do what you want to
Choose your own destiny
Free to do what you want to</pre>
