Summer field hockey is finally over for the season and I can finally talk about it. Becky&#8217;s team did finish undefeated!

Late in the season, they did have two ties in a row, but no losses.

A few weeks back I started doing some calculations using the standings and the the schedule to see if it was possible to NOT end up in first place. Turns out there were more rain dates than I knew about, so that was all pointless time ( if you can call writing Python and playing with number pointless ).

Her last game was on Wednesday. They did NOT need to win to take the trophy, but most of them didn&#8217;t know that, and they DID need to win or tie to stay undefeated. It was a win of at least 4-0, so they finished the season at 11-0-2.

Only 17 days until fall preseason starts. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

NOTE: I&#8217;m doing most of my posting at Fargo now, but I plan to cross post some things here until I move over there ( and point the feed there ).
