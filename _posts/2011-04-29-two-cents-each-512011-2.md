[40 and 44][1]
:   Obama's first year in office is strikingly similar to that of Reagan's. Serioiusly.

[What the Vikings-Saints Game Shows Us About Systems and Mindsets][2]
:   An interesting point about systems. I don't completely buy the Favre argument about mindsets but I understand what the author is trying to say.

[Seth&#8217;s Blog: Hourly work vs. linchpin work][3]
:   "That's quite an hourly wage. It's also quite a bargain." Very well said.

[Get inPulse and Hack Your Watch | Home][4]
:   I want one of these.

[ibd\_baseball\_flowchart.jpg (1000Ã—669)][5]
:   A flow chart to tell you which MLB team to root for. Very funny stuff indeed!

[Upgrading Windows, from 1.0 to 7.0][6]
:   Very strange experiment indeed &#8211; I'm not sure I believe it worked.

[Quora vs. StackExchange: Why, Joel, Why?][7]
:   "Quora is interesting; StackOverflow is important."</p> 
    
    I could not agree more.Â </dd> 
    
    [Daily Kos: Why we must defend Sarah Palin][8]
    :   Agreed. She may be ignorant but we shouldn't call her names &#8211; or bring her gender into it.
    
    [11 Answers To the Biggest Mysteries In Songs and Lyrics &#8211; 11Points.com][9]
    :   The commentary is the funniest part.Â </p> 
        
        Now, as for the mystery of whether or not "In the Air Tonight" has THE single best moment to air drum along to in the history of music&#8230; I'm going to give that an absolute YES.
