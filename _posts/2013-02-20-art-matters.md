Saturday afternoon I retweeted this …

    If schools focused less on math, history, and science and more on art, dance, and recess, I truly believe the world would be a better place.

Art matters!

I’m a programmer and I’ve taught both computer science and math. In addition to that, I spend a lot of time reading about two of my favorite subjects &#8211; evolutionary biology and economics. As a result, people think I’m a “math guy” and I even frequently refer to myself as a scientist. But I’m not all analytical. I come from a long line of musicians on both sides, and I appreciate music &#8211; even musicals <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8211; and film in a big way.

Art matters!

When we visited NYU for a new parent weekend in September 2011, Tisch dean of faculty told the crowd how proud he was that we were brave enough to send our children to an art school, especially given the economic situation. It was a moving speech, and I hope it reassured other parents as much as it did us.

Art matters!

On Saturday, we watched the Oscar nominated documentary shorts. They were all excellent, but two of them stood out to me &#8211; Mondays at Racine and Inocente.

Inocente is a wonderful story about the impact art can have on a young person. Very moving, highly recommended!

As added benefit to seeing this great film was that I learned of a project that I love. It’s called [ARTS][1] ( A Reason To Survive ). I had never heard of this organization before, and I’ve not had time to check them out, etc, but I love the idea, and I can’t say enough how much I like the premise of art as a reason to live.
