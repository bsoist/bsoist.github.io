I am sick over the case of Jerry Sandusky. I am pleased by the jury&#8217;s verdict. Sandusky is a sick man who needs to be locked up for the rest of his life.

His crime is NOT that he is attracted to the same sex. There are others who have same sex attractions who act on those attractions within the confines of the law. His crime is NOT that he is attracted to children. Many people were attracted to teenagers when they were teenagers themselves. Most people grow out of those attractions, so we don&#8217;t understand what he might be feeling, but that is NOT his crime.

His crime, if you ask me, is manipulating those children to his own advantage. 

As the trial began, evidence emerged that Sandusky used many of the same tactics other predators use to manipulate victims. He had them over his house, gave them gifts, and took them on trips, and threatened to take those things away. He also reminded them that noone would believe them. 

He even wrote them letters &#8211; [creepy][1] [love][2] [letters][3]. It&#8217;s [these letters][4] which showcase his manipulation in the extreme. 

> You have begun by choosing to do the program. You will win by staying with it. I hope that you can become a winner.

I wouldn&#8217;t have put it as flippantly and crassly as [this guy][5], but he is right on about one thing &#8211; What kind of sick bastard tells a kid that if he stands up and puts an end to the abuse, he&#8217;s a quitter? How twisted is that?

But he is not the only one to blame.

Covering up the manipulation is just as heinous. We don&#8217;t know exactly [who knew what and when they knew it][6], but one thing is certain &#8211; [nobody did enough][7]. 

I can&#8217;t envision any scenario where those who covered this tragedy up bear any less than **equal responsibility**.
