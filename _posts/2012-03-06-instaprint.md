Today&#8217;s Kickstarter project is [Instaprint &#8211; The location based photo booth for Instagram][1]. 

From the project page &#8230;

> Instaprint is a location based photo booth that can transform parties and events by putting a camera in everyone&#8217;s hand. By setting Instaprint to look out for specific locations or hashtags, any Instagram tagged appropriately will automatically be printed out on inkless paper. Get one for your next party, event, wedding, fiesta&#8230;.

It&#8217;s an ambitious project and I decided not to invest very much, but I really think it&#8217;s an interesting idea.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
