No need to break precedent now. I&#8217;ve posted about every one of our garage sales, so why not now. Today&#8217;s sale was not the event the others were. Our community has these twice a year and the kids love the chance to make some cash. They actually did very well this time. We did buck tradition some though by using the earnings to buy lunch instead of dinner. Lunch is cheaper!
