Today&#8217;s project is [Duende: Suit of Lights][1], a feature film about a man, presumably a matador, who flees into the desert to elude his demons and ends up joining a troupe of rodeo clowns.



See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
