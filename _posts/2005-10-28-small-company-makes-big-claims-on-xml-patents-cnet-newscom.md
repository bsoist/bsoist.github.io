> Charlotte, N.C.-based Scientigo owns two patents (No. 5,842,213 and No. 6,393,426) covering the transfer of &#8220;data in neutral forms.&#8221; These patents, one of which was applied for in 1997, are infringed upon by the data-formatting standard XML, Scientigo executives assert.<cite><a href="http://news.com.com/Small%20company%20makes%20big%20claims%20on%20XML%20patents/2100-1014_3-5905949.html">link</a> </cite>

This reminded me of something I read about a year ago:  


> If I were a patent terrorist like some, I could probably even patent these ideas. IsnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it a shame that in this country today, you can have nothing more than an idea, do nothing with it, but still have a chance to make money?<cite><a href="http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/cuban_bio000329.html">Mark Cuban</a> on <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/7673569691391003/">blogmaverick</a>.</cite></p>
One whiner left a comment on Mark&#8217;s blog complaining that big companies with &#8216;rich friends&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t be the only ones who make money. He says &#8220;Should I not profit from my ideas just because someone else had richer friends?&#8221;Well, philosophers have debated this for centuries. I am going to say &#8220;Yes, you should not profit!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think an &#8216;idea&#8217; is good enough.He also complains that the founders of Google were able to raise $25,000 from friends and family for their idea, something he claims he could not have done. Just a thought &#8211; If you cannot raise $25,000 for an idea that you think should eventually make you rich, then you shouldn&#8217;t expect to get rich.Better keep playin&#8217; the lottery.
