By now, most people have probably seen the [new White House website][1]. 

There are promising signs that this will be an administration that cares to communicate with the public in a much more open way. Most third party content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License][2], the unreasonable restrictions in the robots.txt file have been eliminated (I&#8217;ve seen others credited with finding this first, but it looks to me like it was reported first [here]().), and the blog looks good so far.

Some have [argued][3] that the site doesn&#8217;t go far enough, and I&#8217;d agree in principle; but I think it is a great step in the right direction. The responsibility for the welfare of our society falls on each of us. We must have a government that wants to keep the us informed as well as hear and understand our needs and opinions.

Check out [the new site][1].
