After [posting about Google&#8217;s problem and my subsequent confusion][1], I realized that I didn&#8217;t give Twitter it&#8217;s proper due. I made mention of my tweet and the many other I saw (1200+ in the first hour), but I didn&#8217;t ask the bigger question.

Did Twitter have a hand it getting this problem fixed more quickly than it might have been?
