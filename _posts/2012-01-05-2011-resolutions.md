UPDATE: Please find a list below this post of my updates every month.

Like most recent years, I read a lot about new years resolutions in the week before the new year. This year, a couple things caught my eye.

Jacq from fitarella.com shared [her take][1] on new years resolution which reminds me a lot of Matt Cutts [30 days project][2]. Years ago I actually bought my first digital camera specifically for the purpose of doing a pic a day like Matt had done.

Anyway, I like the idea of replacing traditional resolutions with individual thirty day challenges.

I agree with Derek Sivers about [keeping goals to yourself][3] so Iâ€™m not going to share my goals with you right now. I will tell you two things â€¦

One, I am drawing some inspiration from Matthew Mightâ€™s [12 resolutions for programmers][4].

Two, I am NOT switching from Vim to Emacs!

  1. Jan -Â [One Down, Eleven to Go][5] &#8211; a morning routine
  2. Feb -Â [12 in 12, February Update][6] &#8211; my diet
  3. Mar -Â [A Kick Ass Philanthropist][7] &#8211; backing KickStarter projects
  4. Apr -Â [The Wall of Shame][8] &#8211; writing daily pages
  5. May &#8211; [Failure Friday][9] &#8211; no goal set (kinda ruins the suspense, doesn&#8217;t it?)
  6. June &#8211; [We Don&#8217;t Need No Stinking Widows][10]
