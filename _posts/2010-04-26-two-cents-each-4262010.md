[Alex Payne â€” How I Use TextMate][1]
:   TextMate is my second favorite editor &#8211; after vim of course <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8211; and I love the bundles.

[The Medium &#8211; Beep! &#8211; NYTimes.com][2]
:   A fun read about a great sound and a great word.

[Amazon: You Need To Change Your Idiotic Customer Reviews Policy Right Now][3]
:   I don't like that some authors withhold the Kindle version, but this is not the appropriate way to respond.

[Shut Up & Bring It | Talking Points Memo][4]
:   Yeah!

[Constitutionality of Mandatory Insurance][5]
:   The new health care reform signed into law is not unconstitutional. It might not be perfect, it might not even be good, but it's constitutional.

[UnMarketing Â» Blog Archive Â» How to lose friends and tick off people on FaceBook][6]
:   Wow! What a riot. Read this if you use Facebook and you'd like a good laugh.

[Incredible Izzo Again Defies Odds][7]
:   Another great post about math and sports. I love it.

[&#8216;Grrrr&#8217; Means Many Things in Dog Speak | LiveScience][8]
:   "Even though the humans and their scientific equipment couldn't tell the difference, though, it seemed the dogs could."</p> 
    
    Fascinating.</dd> 
    
    [Series: Why Did Jesus Come? Â« &#8211; Thinking Christian][9]
    :   "in view of the Old Testament context from which he was quoting, it appears he is calling on oppressors to free those they are holding down unjustly. He came to liberate us from our own failings, and to call us to pass that blessing along by liberating others where we have power to do so."</p> 
        
        Jesus spoke for just a few moment and decided to read from Isaiah 61:1. That should make us think twice about a few things.</dd> 
        
        [One sandwich to kill you all][10]
        :   This is one of the funniest pieces I have read in a very long time. You will not be disappointed if you take the time to read the whole thing.
        
        [A New Kind of Starting Pitcher? &#8211; Freakonomics Blog &#8211; NYTimes.com][11]
        :   A fresh interesting idea but I don't see it catching on &#8211; see resistance number six &#8211; but I've watched some teams that would have probably benefited from this.</dl>
