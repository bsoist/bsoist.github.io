As I&#8217;ve [written before][1], I haven&#8217;t read a lot of comic books, or [graphic novels][2] as they&#8217;ve come to be called, in recent years, but my interest has increased now that I&#8217;ve experimented with comics on my iPad.

A couple of weeks ago I just happend to be[<sup>1</sup>][3] right in front of a comic book store with a few minutes to kill so I stopped in to browse. I have been looking to try a &#8220;real&#8221; book again. 

[The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye (v. 1)][4] caught my eye. Billy and I watched the first episode of the [TV show][5] and liked it more than we expected but decided we didn&#8217;t need another show to watch. I decided to try the comic and I&#8217;m glad I did.

Walking Dead is not really about the zombies. It explores the human nature. It answers the question the author claims every watcher of zombie movies asks at the end &#8211; &#8220;now what?&#8221;

If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what happens just after all the zombies wipe out a whole group of people, the author promises you&#8217;ll learn the answers. And he does not disappoint in the first volume. The characters are real people who struggle with adjustment to their new circumstances. And the zombies show up enough to pander to your need for horror and suspense.

One of the reasons I wanted to get back into reading comics was for the artwork. Here, too, this series looks promising. The artist does excellent work and the series is in black and white which I particularly enjoy.

After dropping Billy off for practice Saturday I thought I&#8217;d stop at Panera for some breakfast and a change of working environment. After discovering that everyone else in Northern Delaware must have made the same plan I decided to stop and pick up a few items for our Super Bowl chili. I parked and called Terri to tell her to add the items to [our grocery list][6]. I had a few minutes to kill while I waited.
