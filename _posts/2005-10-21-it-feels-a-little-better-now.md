One of my worst memories as a Jets fan is of that fake spike.  


> As most remember, with little time left, Marino had driven the Dolphins near our goal line and lined up as if he were going to spike the ball to stop the clock. But instead, he faked the spike, and as our defense let up for a split second, Marino threw the winning touchdown. Things were never the same for the Jets after that game. We went on an awful losing streak, the coaches were fired and it took three years for the franchise to turn it around.<cite><a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/8710544">former Jet remembers it too</a></cite></p>
Anytime it comes up, I don&#8217;t want to think about it. It was painful.It does feel a little better now, though. Coach remembered it too! I wonder how long he&#8217;s been waiting to use this.Nice goin&#8217; Pete![NPR : USC Win Tops Frantic Football Weekend][1]
