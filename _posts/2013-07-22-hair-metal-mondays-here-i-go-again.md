I thought after last week, I should post at least one more of our shared favorites.

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve written about this before, but I met Vivian Campbell, Tommy Aldridge, and Rudy Sarzo in a mall in Roanoke, VA years ago when they were on tour with Whitesnake. I looked through the archives here to find a link to that story, but couldn&#8217;t find it. If I really have never shared that, I will someday.

For today, here is one of my favorite hair metal anthems of all time.

NOTES:

  1. I decided to embed a live version rather then the very popular music video that made Coverdale&#8217;s wife famous for several reasons &#8211; mostly because I love the crowd singing along in the live version.
  2. You can stop viewing after the song ends. It goes on for a bit, but all you&#8217;ll miss is Coverdale swearing.

<pre>I don't know where I'm going, but I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in the songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
Here I go again, here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known

Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again, here I go again
Here I go again, here I go

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone</pre>
