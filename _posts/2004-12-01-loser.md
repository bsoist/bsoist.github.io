Well, Ken Jennings has finally lost on Jeopardy. My son and I actully just started following Jeopardy after my Dad told us about Ken. He had about a dozen wins at that point. With TiVO it is easy to keep up with this kind of show. We have a season pass (set to save up to two eps since the show comes on early) so we can sit and watch it at high speed whenever we get the urge. It has been fun watching you Ken. Have a nice life. Billy and I will probably stick with the show for a while and see how the new champ does.
