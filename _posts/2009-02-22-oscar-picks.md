I forgot to post these before the show started. Oops!

I decided to vote as if I were actually voting. This is not the way I would vote if I were trying to guess the winners in Vegas.Â 

The hardest categories for me were Best Leading Actress and Live Action Short. Meryl Streep was the first I saw and I thought for sure noone could top that performance. I&#8217;ve since seen them all and it is a very tough call.

I&#8217;ve placed my second choice for some in parenthesis.
