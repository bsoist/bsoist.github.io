I think I work fairly hard most of the time, I tend to get a lot done, and I&#8217;m happy with the results up to this point (especially in the last five years or so), but I&#8217;ve learned something recently. I get this nagging feeling sometimes that I am working too late into the day, that I should be &#8220;knocking off&#8221; work earlier and spending more time with the family. The problem, however, is that when I do quit for the day I have this urge to get back to it, a feeling that I am not working hard enough, etc. I know I should quit for the day, I know my family is more important than my work. So what is really bothering me? The real truth is &#8211; I&#8217;m not working all the time I think I&#8217;m working. 

I discovered this recently when I mapped out my ideal week. I&#8217;ve recently trimmed my work down to four major components &#8211; a client whose mission I care deeply about, a client that gives me intellectually challenging work that pays the bills, a startup that will transform the way we learn, and an organization I am starting which will help young people learn to detect bullshit.

Since I am committed to those four things and nothing else professionally, I decided to carve out time loosely so they all get the time they deserve. I&#8217;ve tried to block out appointments with myself and the like before but I&#8217;ve always gravitated back toward the GTD mentality to not schedule anything on my calendar that doesn&#8217;t absolutely need to be done at a certain time. This is different. I started with an example spreadsheet and modified it for my needs. After a few days of referring to it, I decided to go ahead and add these blocks of time to my calendar. I know that I can move them around when I need to.

Sticking to it has been liberating and enlightening. I&#8217;ve always suspected that I waste a little time but this, and what I learned a couple of weeks ago, shows me that I can get a handle on it. And it gives purpose to my day. If I work the plan, I feel very comfortable quitting at 6:30 and I don&#8217;t think about work like I used to.
