At this time [last year][1], I wrote about four lessons I learned in 2010. This year I thought I&#8217;d look back at those lessons and consider what I might have learned in 2011. 

## 2010

  * Things Aren&#8217;t Always As They Seem  
    No evidence in 2011 to overturn this theory.
  * Life Is Hard  
    No question about it!
  * I Need to Play More Video Games  
    I&#8217;ve played more this year, and it really helped. I enjoy it and I&#8217;ve actually learned quite a bit about gameplay mechanics. 
  * My Kids Are Growing Up  
    Still the hardest thing for me to deal with. My daughter is a teenager now and my son seems to be doing just fine a hundred miles away from his parents.

## 2011

While I certainly learned some things last year, nothing stands out as much to me. What does stand out is a few lessons reinforced.

  * There Is A God  
    Those of you familiar with my thinking know that I&#8217;m not the kind of theist who believes because he wants to. I believe in God because I simply know he exists. I don&#8217;t have a philosophical problem accepting a world where God doesn&#8217;t exist, but I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case. I&#8217;ve never felt more strongly about it.
  * There Is a Lot of Hate in the World  
    The economic and political climate in the U.S. and the death of Osama bin Laden brought this to the front of my thinking. I love my country as much as anyone, but I don&#8217;t hate anyone &#8211; even if they disagree with me.
  * The NBA Is a Waste of Time  
    I know this is not a serious issue, but it was worth mentioning. I think Basketball is flawed game to begin with, but the NBA is the worst kind of basketball. Just to be clear, I am not just a jaded fan who is mad at the players. I actually sided with them during this last dispute.
