On Wednesday, Cory Doctorow wrote [an excellent piece][1] in response to an [Op-Ed piece by Roy Blount Jr.][2] to which I&#8217;ve [linked before][3]

Today, Peter Glaskowsky at CNET [tells us][4] that he has been &#8220;sorely tempted&#8221; to write a formal response to Doctorow&#8217;s essay but he decides instead to dismiss it as &#8220;grossly deceitful&#8221; and move along to his own opinion on the matter.

I&#8217;d like to see Mr. Glaskowsky at least attempt to answer the questions Doctorow and other have rasied.
