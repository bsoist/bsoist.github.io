I just finished the Sunday morning shows. Running a little late this week <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Â Meet the Press featured a panel of ordained ministers this week for a discussion of politics and religion. If I had known the agenda, I would have watched this on Sunday, but thanks to TiVOâ„¢ (and my son) I didn&#8217;t miss it.Â The panel included[Jerry Falwell][1],[Jim Wallis][2],[Al Sharpton][3], and[Dr. Richard Land][4].Â I am sure I have written of this before, but I am a graduate of[Liberty University][5] where Dr. Falwell is chancellor. I am very proud of my faith and am pleased with the education I received at LU. However, I have never agreed with everything that is taught. I am sure I was visibly disgusted every time I heard Dr. Falwell recite some of the points of his statement of faith during an assembly. (It still gets me when I hear it or read it.)Â I must say that after his appearance on Sunday, I am deeply disappointed. Of course, his behavior did not surprise me, **but it still upsets me.** What bothers me most of all is that he was the only panelist who questioned (aloud at least) the faith of the others on the panel based on politics. Even Dr. Land, who spent much of his time rolling his eyes and seemed intent on dredging up his thoughts on the civil rights movement (which he should probably avoid), stated that he **did not** question the faith of the others (Rev. Wallis in particular) because of politics.Â I just find it hard to believe that some believers feel that all believers must vote the same way in a political election. What bothers me more than anything is that I personally know people who agree with the narrow minded thinking of Dr. Falwell.
