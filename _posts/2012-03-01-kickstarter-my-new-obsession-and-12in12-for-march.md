I know it&#8217;s not a good idea to announce my goal before I&#8217;ve accomplished it, but I wanted to blog about this one every day so I guess I have to.

I&#8217;ve decided for March to back one Kickstarter project every day. I don&#8217;t have a lot of money to invest in this right now and I may only invest a few dollars in each one, but I believe in what Kickstarter is trying to do and I desperately want to be a part of making good things happen.

So here goes &#8230;
