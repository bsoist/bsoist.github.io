Just before the end of last month, I accepted a project that would require I use Windows quite a bit. Since I was looking for another [12in12][1] project, I decided I would make it using Windows every day. I&#8217;ve already been spending a lot of time using Windows 8 every Friday, so I thought it would be fun to give it a shot. Until recently, I would go weeks without using Windows for any real length of time. 

The rules were that I would spend at least one hour a day using some flavor of Windows. Using it just for my work was okay, but I also had a plan in mind to use it a little bit just for fun. I have three VMs on my Mac (Mint Linux, Win7, and Win8), and I have three laptops (same flavors), so I would be able to use in almost any circumstance. There were even a few times when I grabbed one of the Windows laptops instead of the my normal laptop (a Macbook Pro running Mint) for a little writing or something. It took some getting used to in terms of workflow, but I didn&#8217;t lose much time adjusting.

In the end, I have a better appreciation for Windows and some of it&#8217;s strengths. I&#8217;ve also discovered that for some types of work, Windows might actually help me focus more on what I&#8217;m doing. Another thing that I&#8217;ve noticed is that using multiple Windows computers seems to be a lot easier than it used to be. Years ago, one of the things I liked about the Mac was that .Mac made it painless (mostly) to work on multiple Macs. Back then, using multiple PCs seemed to be impossible (perhaps I just didn&#8217;t have the right tools. Now, with almost everything I do &#8220;in the cloud&#8221; it&#8217;s not only easy to work on multiple PCs, but I can share work between my Mac, PCs, and even my phone and iPad. 

I plan to continue my mixed use. We&#8217;ll see how it goes
