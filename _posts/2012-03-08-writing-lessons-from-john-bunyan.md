Yesterday I started reading **Pilgrimâ€™s Progress** again for the latest installment of [Reading Classics Together][1] and I stumbled onto something Iâ€™ve never noticed before. I am reading the online version at [CCEL][2] and I was intrigued by the section titled [The Authorâ€™s Apology for His Book][3]. I may have read this before, but I donâ€™t remember it.

The book is full of great lessons for the Christian, but the apology contains at least two lessons for the writer that I thought were worth noting.

One, that the work seemed to become something other than what the author originally intended. Iâ€™ve certainly noticed this in my own writing &#8211; especially in works of fiction.

Two, this portion â€¦

> Well, when I had thus put mine ends together  
> I showâ€™d them others, that I might see whether  
> They would condemn them, or them justify:  
> And some said, let them live; some, let them die:  
> Some said, John, print it; others said, Not so:  
> Some said, It might do good; others said, No.

Bunyan goes on to explain why he decided to share his work, but the lesson is clear &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter that some people don&#8217;t see value in your writing.
