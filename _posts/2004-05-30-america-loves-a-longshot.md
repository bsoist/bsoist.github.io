We&#8217;ve just finished watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFFCLIW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HFFCLIW&linkCode=as2&tag=weifyoasme-20&linkId=WPA5RFMNBHT67PR2">Seabiscuit</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00HFFCLIW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Exceptional acting, breathtaking scenery and an inspirational story. How could one go wrong. To be honest, I was very leary of even trying this movie. Normally, these cliche &#8216;underdog wins&#8217; movies don&#8217;t sit well with me. I&#8217;m also not a big fan of sports movies. As a huge sports fan I feel like most movies don&#8217;t do justice to the &#8216;real thing.&#8217; Many reviewers promised that since the film was based on a true story it would not seem as sappy or predictable. Of course, I am always suspicious of the *based* on a true story tag anyway. In the end the movie did not disappoint. The first hour seemed a little slow, and frankly I was not sure I would make it through. I&#8217;m glad I did. Not really sure if too much could have been removed. Part of the appeal at the end is the kinship you feel with the characters due to your *history* together. Some would say it was *worth it*, but it seems unfortunate to me that somtimes we have to justify the beginning of a movie by saying the ending is better. Truth is, though &#8212; this is one of those movies! If you get bored, just joke about it like we did and keep watching. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
