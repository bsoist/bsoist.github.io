We&#8217;ve just finished watching [Seabiscuit.][1] Exceptional acting, breathtaking scenery and an inspirational story. How could one go wrong. To be honest, I was very leary of even trying this movie. Normally, these cliche &#8216;underdog wins&#8217; movies don&#8217;t sit well with me. I&#8217;m also not a big fan of sports movies. As a huge sports fan I feel like most movies don&#8217;t do justice to the &#8216;real thing.&#8217; Many reviewers promised that since the film was based on a true story it would not seem as sappy or predictable. Of course, I am always suspicious of the *based* on a true story tag anyway. In the end the movie did not disappoint. The first hour seemed a little slow, and frankly I was not sure I would make it through. I&#8217;m glad I did. Not really sure if too much could have been removed. Part of the appeal at the end is the kinship you feel with the characters due to your *history* together. Some would say it was *worth it*, but it seems unfortunate to me that somtimes we have to justify the beginning of a movie by saying the ending is better. Truth is, though &#8212; this is one of those movies! If you get bored, just joke about it like we did and keep watching. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
