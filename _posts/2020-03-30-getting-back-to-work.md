I put blogging on hold for a bit when I went back to teaching.

Today was going to be our first day back to school after a two-week Spring break, but because of COVID-19 students will be returning to school via remote learning tomorrow. 

Teachers return today for a day of meetings, practice, and support. We've been planning for this for months, so I think we are all prepared, but most of us, I think, are still a little anxious about how things will go. 

Big day today!
