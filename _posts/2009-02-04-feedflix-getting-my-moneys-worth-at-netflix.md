I&#8217;ve said this before &#8211; I love Netflix. 

I first discovered Netflix via it&#8217;s affiliate program in 2000. I&#8217;d been using the Internet for years but I was just starting my online profit-making ventures. The thought of shelling out $24.99 per month to get movies in the mail was much too expensive for me compared to the system I&#8217;d used since 1982 but I loved the idea and apparently lots of others did too because the affiliate program was very profitable. Netflix actually helped me survive through several months when not much other income was coming in. 

I finally subscribed myself when the price fell to $5.99 a month and my family loved the experience. We liked it so much we decided to set my son up with his own BlockBuster Online account so he could have his own queue and we were could drop movies off at the store and pick up a movie on a whim &#8211; something that was not possible on Netflix (until they released instant watching &#8211; don&#8217;t get me started on that, I love it!). 

There was something dreadfully wrong with BB compared to Netflix, though. It came with that feeling that I was being exploited by a giant corporation that cared little about my experience. They insisted on tacking on $0.08 per month for the DE rental tax, they always insisted on identification though I&#8217;d frequented that location for four years, they changed the terms of the coupon program, the price went up etc. Meanwhile, Netflix sends me an email announcing a reduction in the rate to $4.99! So, we ditched BB and jacked up our membership at Netflix to 5 movies at a time. 

Then we found out about the sub-queues and I read something about Netflix users blowing through 80+ movies per month and my son and I realized the potential for seeing some great movies. We thought we were getting our money&#8217;s worth but we knew we could do better. Like most users we&#8217;d hold on to a movie for longer than we should. So, we set up my son for two per month and my wife, daughter and I for one each. 

A couple of weeks ago I discovered [FeedFlix][1], a site that would let me check on my account to see if I was truly getting a good value. On my first check, it only gauged my queue and my cost per movie was $2.55. I asked about support for sub-queues and learned that they expected to have that in place soon. I did not hear back from them but my last check worked as I wanted. It recognized me as a five-per-month and my price per movie is now $1.98. 

What I&#8217;d like to see now is the ability to check each queue separately. Now that I think about it I realize that may be what the [FeedFlix][1] team meant when they told me they were working on support for sub-queues. If so, we should expect it soon. If not, this is my official request to have that done. I&#8217;d like to see how my son does on his. I am going to guess less than $1 per. My wife and daughter will be much higher. Obviously, it&#8217;s just my overly curious geekiness &#8211; the important thing is the total cost for all five. 

If you&#8217;d like to know if you are getting your money&#8217;s worth check it out. You can also find recommendations and learn some other interesting things about your use like the amount of time you hold DVDs on average. 

Have fun!
