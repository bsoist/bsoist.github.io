I <a href="http://www.bsoi.st/oped/2014/09/22/whenDidChristianityBecomeAllAboutOneOrTwoPoliticalIssues.html">wrote recently</a> that I was saddened that too high a percentage of posts from some of the Christian blogs I read focus on one or two issues, and when they talk about them they over emphasize the politics. Well, I feel like I have to talk about one of those issues today. I read something the other day and I wanted to post a knee-jerk reaction, but I decided to let the tab sit open in my browser and see if I was still in the mood after a few days passed.
I am.
Albert Mohler calls homosexuality the <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/09/24/homosexuality-as-dividing-line-the-inescapable-issue/">inescapable issue</a> and states that a church must affirm or not affirm homosexual marriages. He says there is no "third way." 
I could not agree more, but he and I would disagree on the side we take on this issue.
I am on the side of affirmation. Plain. And. Simple.
