Just finished watching a piece on [ABC&#8217;s NightLine][1] about lobbyists [Jack Abramoff][2] and [Michael Scanlone][3]. Abramoff was paid millions of dollars by one native american tribe to protect its interests in DC. He used some of that money to hire [Ralph Reed][4] to stop a native american casino in Texas. Then when the casino was shut down, he moves in at the last minute to offer his &#8216;services&#8217; to them. Am I the only one who thinks this a classic technique of organized crime? This is despicable. Follow the story at [Indianz.com][5]
