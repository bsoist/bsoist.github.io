I decided to start my new blogging routine today and I noted a link in my [last post][1] &#8211; &#8220;[How much will the Mets miss Tom Glavine?&#8221; ][2]

Not much, huh?

Anyway, I plan to start with a few book and DVD reviews since I am changing the way those display on my [homepage][3]. After that, maybe I&#8217;ll have something to say about the election.
