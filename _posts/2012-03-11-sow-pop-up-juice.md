Today&#8217;s project is [SÅW Pop-Up Juice][1].

I like the idea of offering fresh juice made from local, organic, and seasonal produce. I also love the idea of re-purposing an existing location. 

I just realized that I can embed the project videos here. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 



See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
