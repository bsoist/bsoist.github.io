Terri and I have had the house to ourselves this week. Billy and Becky are both travelling. 

Billy was home from NYU for a few weeks before he went off to Germany for a while. In about ten days, he leaves Germany for San Francisco, and then he will return to us just before Independence Day. Becky has been in New Orleans helping with some reconstruction projects. She returns tomorrow.

It&#8217;s been about 15 years since it&#8217;s been just us for more than a day or two, and the last time we were in Haiti so it wasn&#8217;t exactly alone time. It&#8217;s been an interesting glimpse into what life might be like someday. 

We&#8217;ve enjoyed it, but we miss both of them.
