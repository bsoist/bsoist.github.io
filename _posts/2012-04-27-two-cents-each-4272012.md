[The Definitive Christian Review of The Hunger Games Â« YINKAHDINAY][1]
:   &#34;Was the violence gratuitous and overly graphic?Â  That depends what youâ€™re measuring it against.Â  Compared to the Berenstain Bears or the Hardy Boys, yes, it was way over the top.Â  Compared to Ehudâ€™s exploits in Judges, not so much.&#34; Very well said. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

[Spirit Airlines, Where &#34;Dying Of Cancer&#34; Equals &#34;Not Following The Rules&#34; &#8211; The Consumerist][3]
:   I absolutely hate it when companies hide behind policies and the &#34;if we do it for you &#8230;&#34; defense. Policies exist to protect the airline from unpredictable loss, but they can be broken on a case by case basis. Give the guy his $197 back and get back to important business.
