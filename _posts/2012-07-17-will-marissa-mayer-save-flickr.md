A couple of months ago, I started thinking about ditching Flickr in favor of some other service. I quickly learned that others had searched in vain for a replacement. Like the author of [this post][1], I decided that alternatives were not much better. Certainly not &#8220;better enough&#8221; for me to switch. 

Not long after my son mentioned to me that he was planning to switch. I told him what I had learned and we just left it at that. He continued to use it. We had the same conversation about a week ago.

Then yesterday, he was testing and experimenting with alternative services while we watched *Breaking Bad*. Once again, I agreed with him that there really should be a better service, but I&#8217;ve not found one that motivated me to switch. (I&#8217;m not a photographer and I go for months without posting). His next comment was really the problem with Flickr, and with all Yahoo! properties, if you ask me. 

He said, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want Yahoo! to destroy it.&#8221;

A few minutes later when I picked up my iPad to check Twitter, Facebook, and G+, everyone was talking about the same thing &#8211; [Marissa Mayer, the new CEO at Yahoo!][2]. Almost everyone in my circles was thrilled by the news. It seems there might be hope for Yahoo!

So, maybe there is hope for Flickr!
