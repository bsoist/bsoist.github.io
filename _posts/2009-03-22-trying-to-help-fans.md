My [latest project][1] was not a money making venture at all. It was motivated by my love for baseball and disdain for the outrageous price of attending games.

I set up my newest website, [getmetstickets.com][2], as a way to help fans who might not otherwise be able to attend.

I was excited to see the site mentioned in today&#8217;s NY Post but I was disappointed they did not stress the donation angle of the story. It was originally planned for a longer story. 

If you can afford to help, please do. If not, please help by getting out the word. Tell your friends, tweet about it, and/or [Digg the story][3] for me.
