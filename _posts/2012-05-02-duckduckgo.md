I&#8217;ve been using [DuckDuckGo][1] as my default search engine for several weeks now and I am very happy with it. 

I started using it mostly because I was displeased with the relevancy of my Google results. My skill at crafting the right query is certainly not perfect, but I&#8217;m sure that is not the problem. I understand Boolean logic and I&#8217;ve been keeping up with how to craft Google queries since Google launched. The problem is NOT my searching skills.

I stayed with DuckDuckGo so far, for three reasons &#8230;

  1. My results are better. I do still check Google and even Bing occasionally to make sure I&#8217;m not missing anything.
  2. Their [privacy policies][2]!
  3. I like the new kid on the block.

Today I stumbled onto [DuckDuckHack][3]. Now I am even more excited about the direction they are going. It&#8217;s not world changing stuff, but I like the community driven nature of it all. 

I&#8217;m planning to work on a [few plugins myself][4].
