More than twenty years ago, I was injured on the job. My employer acted as though they were worried about me, but I learned later that everything they did &#8211; including paying for my treatment &#8211; was motivated by self interest. I was not seriously injured, but many others are not as lucky as I was. 

If you ever find yourself injured on the job, do not expect your employer, no matter how nice they might be, to look out for your interests. Consult with [Workers Comp Lawyer Dalton GA][1].

They specialize in offering personal, professional service in all types of workplace and industrial accidents. There is no charge for consultation, and they are conveniently located for clients located in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. You deserve to be treated fairly, let someone help you.[ Workers Comp Lawyer Dalton GA][1]
