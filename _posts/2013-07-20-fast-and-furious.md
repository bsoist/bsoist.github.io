I [wrote yesterday][1] about the Fast and Furious movie marathon we planned at our place several weeks back. The series as a whole was much better than I expected. I enjoyed the movies and it was a fun day.

I thought I’d just relay a couple of brief thoughts about each one.

## The Fast and the Furious

A decent film that is fun to watch if you like fast cars.

## 2 Fast 2 Furious

One of the worst films I’ve ever seen, and though I do like the cheesy titles sequels have these days, this is one of the silliest titles of any movie &#8211; ever!

## The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

Not as good as the first, better than the second. The change of culture was interesting. This film feels like it doesn’t fit into the story line of the other films at all, but they do bring one of the characters into later films.

## Fast & Furious

I think this may be the second best of the films. At this point, the films drop most of the macho games nonsense I hate so much and start to focus more on the heists.

## Fast Five

Certainly the best film if you ask me &#8211; by quite a lot.

## Furious 6

This is probably a better film than number four, but it really pushes the boundaries of plausibility. It was a blast to see it in the theater with a crowd that was very enthusiastic about it. It was a great way to round out the day.
