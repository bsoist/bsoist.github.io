If you know me, or have read more than a few things I’ve written, you’ll know that I have written about my faith before, and that …

  * I believe God exists &#8211; not because I want to, but because I simply believe
  * I have [questions][1] about my faith, and I think that’s okay.
  * I feel more comfortable in a [community of people who feel the same way][2].
  * I think faith should [unite people, not divide them][3].
  * I believe my country was founded as a secular nation [for good reason][4], and [I am proud of that][5].
  * I find [much in common with people of no religious faith][6].

I’ve been thinking a lot about this recently, but it’s on my mind today as I work on a book review.

I don’t have the training or the energy to get into a protracted debate about the nature of knowledge or the meaning of faith, but I can tell you that two statements can sum up my theism.

I believe &#8211; very strongly &#8211; that there is a God.

I know that I can’t know there is a God.

Does that make me an agnostic? And if I am, does that mean I can&#8217;t be a Christian? born again? saved? redeemed? 

I don&#8217;t subscribe to everything I was taught as a child, but I still believe the &#8220;important&#8221; stuff. 

So, I guess I can be an agnostic and a Christian at the same time, right?

NOTE: I know of at least some who use the term agnostic in a sense similar to the way programmers might say something about being “language agnostic” or “tool agnostic” when they mean that one things is just as good as the other. I am not using the term that way (and I’m not sure those examples are legitimate use of the term, but I’m not a linguist ). I mean agnostic in the strict sense that I know that I can’t know that God exists.
