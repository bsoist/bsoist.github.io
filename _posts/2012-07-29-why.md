Recently I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the big questions of life &#8211; what is the meaning of life? what happens after death? does God exist? things like that.

I&#8217;ve always said that I have questioned everything I have ever believed except one thing &#8211; the existence of God. I have had serious doubts about the God of the Bible, the inspiration of Scripture, the interpretation of many passages, and other details, but never really questioned God&#8217;s existence.

Recently that has changed. Several things have contributed to that.

  1. I&#8217;ve spent many years reading the works of atheists, talking with them, debating the existence of God with them, etc. Many of them are the most thoughtful, intelligent people I have ever met.
  2. I have always thought a world without a creator creator was an inspiring idea. I&#8217;ve always believed God exists, but I think I&#8217;d be willing to accept if there were not.
  3. I&#8217;ve never been the kind of theist who &#8220;needed&#8221;¬ù to believe in God. Much like C.S. Lewis, I believe because I believe, not because I want to.
  4. I&#8217;ve grown increasingly concerned about the nature of the church in the U.S. In my opinion, many U.S. churches represent an over-emphasis on conservative politics, a fear of science, [the marginalization of women][1], and discrimination against minorities. I also think far too many Christians accept whatever their church teaches with little regard for searching out the truth for themselves.

I have even begun to question the very existence of God, and even more so the existence of the God described in the Bible &#8211; the God of Judaism and Christianity.

A little more than two months ago, I was thinking about why these questions were so heavy on my heart and a thought that really bothered me popped into my head. I had been reading the Bible at an accelerated pace over the last six months. I&#8217;ve read the Bible for years, but now I was reading a very large chunk every day. Could all of that reading be the thing that makes me wonder? I&#8217;ve read the Bible intentionally like this before, and I&#8217;ve read it daily for long periods of time many times before, and I&#8217;ve read large chunks in short time frames before. I&#8217;ve even studied every book in a formal setting (most books at least twice) and in informal study (not just devotion). Was I seeing things differently now? Why?

Or perhaps something else was going on. I really don&#8217;t know.

The very next day we visited another church in the area ([we were searching for a new church, but I&#8217;m sure that had nothing to do with my questions about God][3]). The sermon was just what I needed to hear. I&#8217;ve never, in many years of attending church, felt as though the message was designed just for me. This was, by far, the best sermon I had heard in a long time. It was an appropriate message for me &#8211; and, I think, for this period in the history of the Christian church in America. There is too much dogma in our churches and not enough of what I would consider real faith &#8211; following without worry ing about if it all makes sense.

Early in the sermon the pastor said &#8220;I know I&#8217;m not supposed to ask why, but &#8230;&#8221; and then he went on to explain that it was okay to ask why. It&#8217;s okay to wonder about what God is doing. It&#8217;s okay to have questions.

I cold not agree more. Keep the questions coming.

The next week we went back to the same church a different pastor preached. I was affected by his prayer in a powerful way. Last week I wrote about how [some of the prayers I hear really bug me][5], but this was a completely different attitude. It was refreshing, to say the least.
