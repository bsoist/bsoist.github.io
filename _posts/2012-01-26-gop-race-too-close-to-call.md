I&#8217;ve not watched one Republican debate. I&#8217;ve watched a few clips and I&#8217;ve read a lot of commentary on them, but I have not tuned in to one of them yet.

Tonight will be my first.

As voters in Florida prepare to vote on Tuesday, I can&#8217;t help bu think they are as confused about the candidates as I. The three states to vote previously have each chosen a different candidate. Another candidate currently polling in fourth place was a serious challenger in Iowa. Another came from behind to take the win in South Carolina, and is now virtually tied with the candidate everyone expected to be the frontrunner.

Take a look at the most recent poll numbers.

  BUT the most telling poll is that <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/january_2012/33_of_gop_voters_say_it_would_be_good_if_new_candidate_entered_presidential_race">33% of GOP Voters Say It Would Be Good If New Candidate Entered Presidential Race</a>! I know the general election is months away, but I still find this fascinating that a third of Republican voters feel this way about their slate of choices. Perhaps I&#8217;m reading too much into it.
</p>

Another thing I find interesting is that not only is the race close, but the candidates seem very different from one another. It&#8217;s as if the Republican party is splitting into separate factions altogether. In my opinion, the only thing these candidates have in common is that they are all deeply flawed.
