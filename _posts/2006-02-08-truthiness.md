As I wait on hold the other day, a voice keeps interrupting the music to tell me how important my call is to them. It occured to me then how insincere it seemed.Then I read [A Billion People Can Be Wrong ][1] in Steve Rushin&#8217;s SI column. He points out the same thought and talks about the insincerity of many sports expressions. We now live in a world of &#8220;truthiness.&#8221;btw,While finding the link I noticed that Steve Rushin was named National Sportswriter of the Year. Congratulations, Steve.
