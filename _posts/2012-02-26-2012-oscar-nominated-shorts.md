I didn&#8217;t see the documentaries this year, but I did get a chance to see the others

## Animated

I didn&#8217;t think these were that great this year so I&#8217;m not going to comment on them individually. Most were silent too, so no quotes.

**My Pick:***<u>The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</u>*

## Live Action

**My Pick:***<u>Tuba Atlantic</u>*

### *  
Pentecost  
*

> Go out there and have the best mass of your lives. 

Loads of fun &#8211; the audience erupted in applause when it ended.

### *  
Raju  
*

> And what will you tell them? 

A film that takes itself too seriously. My least favorite by a long shot.

### *  
The Shore  
*

> They&#8217;ve brought in a horse? 

A wonderfully quirky story about love and family. Great stuff &#8211; and very funny.

### *  
Time Freak  
*

> Don&#8217;t you dare! 

As much as I love time travel and the premise of this film, it fell short in my opinion.

### *  
Tuba Atlantic  
*

> That was very precise. 

Very interesting characters in a strange story. The best of the films in my opinion.
