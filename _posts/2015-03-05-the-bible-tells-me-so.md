I can't recommend it enough. The author brings out some distinctions and interpretations that even long time readers of the Bible may have never considered before. I found it enlightening and liberating.

The only issue I take with the book is that the author seems to leave little room in his thinking for miracles. He seems to believe only things he can prove or things that "make sense" - an approach I understand but do not share. The author hints at rejecting the doctrine of Jesus' virgin birth, for example. I agree with the author that it's not an essential doctrine, but I accept it because I believe God can choose to break natural laws as he sees fit.

Some Christinas have called the book dangerous because the author doesn't hold to inerrancey and infallibily of Scripture. I do not share that concern. I do accept that the Bible is [inerrant and infallible][inerrant], but I don't believe that accepting those things is a a requirement to be a ["true Christian"][whatkind]. I just don't see any good reason that one **must** believe those things. 

I will have more to say about that next week.
