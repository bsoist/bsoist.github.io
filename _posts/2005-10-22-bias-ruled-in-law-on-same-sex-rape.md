I may not like what these teens did, but I certainly don&#8217;t think the punishment shoud have been 17 years in prison!  


> The Kansas Supreme Court yesterday struck down a state law that penalized same-sex statutory rapes by 18-year-olds much more harshly than heterosexual cases, ruling that the law unconstitutionally discriminated against gays.In a 6 to 0 opinion, the court said its decision was required by the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas , a landmark victory for gay rights that abolished all state laws criminalizing sodomy between consenting adults.</p>
