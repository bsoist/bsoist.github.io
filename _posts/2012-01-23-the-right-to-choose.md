The Right to Choose

I know this is a controversial subject, but I feel just as strongly about this as many of my fellow Christian friends who disagree with me. As I&#8217;ve [written before][1], I think abortion is a terrible tragedy, but I believe in the right to choose. 

Yesterday was the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision protecting a woman&#8217;s right to choose. President Obama issued a statement that I think is worth reading carefully.

> > As we mark the 39th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must remember that this Supreme Court decision not only protects a womanâ€™s health and reproductive freedom, but also affirms a broader principle: that government should not intrude on private family matters. I remain committed to protecting a womanâ€™s right to choose and this fundamental constitutional right. While this is a sensitive and often divisive issue- no matter what our views, we must stay united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant woman and mothers, reduce the need for abortion, encourage healthy relationships, and promote adoption. And as we remember this historic anniversary, we must also continue our efforts to ensure that our daughters have the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities as our sons to fulfill their dreams.

A couple of things worthy of note &#8230;

> > a broader principle: that government should not intrude on private family matters.

I could not agree more.

> > we must stay united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant woman and mothers, reduce the need for abortion, encourage healthy relationships, and promote adoption.

How could anyone disagree with this?

> > we must also continue our efforts to ensure that our daughters have the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities as our sons to fulfill their dreams.

Wow, we have a lot more work to do in this department, don&#8217;t we?
