As you may have gathered if you follow me anywhere online, I am a big fan of [nakedpastor&#8217;s][1] art. 

This particular cartoon reminded me of a Sunday morning years ago. Terri and I were riding with her family to enjoy a meal after the Sunday morning service. As we drove past all the boaters out on the water, Terri&#8217;s said something that sparked a disagreement with her brother. I don&#8217;t remember exactly what he said, but the gist was this &#8230;

> I don&#8217;t see how anyone could enjoy spending Sunday morning that way. 

Terri&#8217;s brother, who was a teenager at the time, responded as some of you may have when you read that. He called his dad out on what he interpreted as dishonesty. Again, I don&#8217;t remember the words exactly, but the message stuck with me. 

> What is that supposed to mean? What do you mean, you don&#8217;t understand how someone could enjoy that? 

I should mention that Terri&#8217;s dad owned a boat and took it out occasionally for recreation, fishing, etc. The very kind of activity these other boaters were engaged in that Sunday morning. His point was that he didn&#8217;t see how anyone could enjoy skipping church.

I stayed out of the conversation because if I were forced to take a side in that argument, I would have certainly sided with my brother-in-law. I would thoroughly enjoy spending Sunday morning on a boat, or flying a kite, or having a picnic, or going to a ball game, or a boatload <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> of other fun things to do outside the church.
