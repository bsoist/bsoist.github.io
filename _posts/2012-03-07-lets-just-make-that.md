The Kickstarter project for today is [Let&#8217;s Just Make That! Tv Show and Workshops][1].

From the project website &#8230;

> Letâ€™s Just Make That! is a TV show that turns people into makers by teaching them how to build their own home furnishings and fix their own home repairs. We used to be a nation of builders, but now we dial a handyman or go to Wal-Mart to buy furniture that is destined to fall apart in a year.

Some of us wouldn&#8217;t dare step foot in Wal-Mart, but otherwise I agree with her point.

I decided to back this for a few reasons, but the biggest is that I think she is hitting on a big issue here. Our economy relies on replacement purchases. It thrives on over consumption which requires waste. If this project will help eliminate waste and teach people to solve their own problems instead of outsourcing everything, I&#8217;m all for it.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
