Haven&#8217;t posted in a while. Things finally settled down at work a little, but May is a hectic month and Billy is playing baseball (did I mention that?). So, we&#8217;ve been busy. Billy had three games this week. In game three the boys played very well. In the second inning we were down 4-0 with the bases loaded and two outs. All of a sudden the coach yells, "Wait, wait, where's Soistmann?" He called time and made sure he got Billy to pinch hit. Wow, pinch hitting. Good stuff Bill. See Billy in action [here.][1]
