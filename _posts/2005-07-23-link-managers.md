I&#8217;ve been using [Furl][1] and [del.icio.us][2] for some time now. I use them in combination much like [recommended by Amy Gahran][3] and [Saurier Duval][4]. I used [de.lirio.us][5] instead of [del.icio.us][2] at first, but have moved to [del.icio.us][2]. It&#8217;s been more reliable and I like the to be able to grab my links via the api. I post them to my link blog using a daily cron job.

About a month ago, I ran into [this post][6] by Michael Wexler 4/28/2004 (who [hates tags][7]) comparing some other services. I decided to search for more info and see if I had missed a better site. I found a good list by [Clay Shirky][8], and a great set of reviews [by Kossatsch][9] ([version 2][10], [version 3][11], and [pdf chart][12]). I&#8217;ve played with most of these sites over the last month and I&#8217;ve decided to stick with the system I&#8217;ve been using.

I&#8217;ve had fun though, and did some interesting reading about [tags][13], [tag literacy][14], [folksonomies][15] and [controlled vocabularies][16].
