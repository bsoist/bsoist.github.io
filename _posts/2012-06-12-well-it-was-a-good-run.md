I&#8217;m disappointed the Devils season ended the way it did, but they really made it exciting there at the end. I really thought they might pull it out and come back from being down three games to none. It was not to be.

And how about those Mets, huh? What&#8217;s the deal there? Things started off very nicely. I tried not to talk too much about it, but I was really starting to think this might be our year. They&#8217;ve lost six of their last seven games, and it&#8217;s starting to feel familiar again.
