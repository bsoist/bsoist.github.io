A while back I found a site that&#8217;s a whole lot of fun. Every post is a fun representation of an interesting observation. A lot of Venn diagrams and charts but more fun than math class for most people. I like math class but I know most people don&#8217;t. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

The author explains the site this way:

> This site is a little project that lets me make fun of some things and sense of others. I use it to think a little more relationally without resorting to doing actual math.
