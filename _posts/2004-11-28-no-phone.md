After waiting until almost 2p.m., the Verizon tech comes to the door to tell us we have to wait until tomorrow to have a dial tone.Â Yesterday at about 4 we lost our dail tone. I called the phone company and they told me someone would visit on Sunday to take a look &#8212; *between 8 and 5* <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Â The man at the door tells me he has to come back tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.Â If you are trying to call, you will be re-directed to the vox with a message that we are on the phone. Don&#8217;t let that fool ya, we are not on the phone.Â After it&#8217;s fixed I will put a request in for a refund of charges for the time missed. Not gonna hold my breath though.Â
