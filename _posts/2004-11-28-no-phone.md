After waiting until almost 2p.m., the Verizon tech comes to the door to tell us we have to wait until tomorrow to have a dial tone. Yesterday at about 4 we lost our dail tone. I called the phone company and they told me someone would visit on Sunday to take a look &#8212; *between 8 and 5* <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> The man at the door tells me he has to come back tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. If you are trying to call, you will be re-directed to the vox with a message that we are on the phone. Don&#8217;t let that fool ya, we are not on the phone. After it&#8217;s fixed I will put a request in for a refund of charges for the time missed. Not gonna hold my breath though.
