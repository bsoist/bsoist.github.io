I was thinking about the [Ahlquist v. Cranston][1] case the other day.

What if your local school had an eight foot tall banner on which was printed a prayer opening with &#8220;Our Heavenly Mother&#8221; or something else offensive to mainline evangelical Christians? What if it were a Buddhist, Hindu, or Muslim prayer?

I&#8217;m serious. I know many will dismiss this out of hand as &#8220;not the point&#8221; or with &#8220;that would never happen because this is a Christian natiion&#8221; &#8211; but I think it is the only way to look at this.

I know a lot of Christians are frustrated and/or furious about this case and others like it. I know it&#8217;s hard to understand people who see the world differently than we do. I know it&#8217;s hard to fathom someone might not &#8220;believe&#8221; at all. I know it&#8217;s hard to believe that anyone would be offended by a prayer as mainstream, inclusive, and &#8220;innocent&#8221; as the one at the center of this case. (the prayer is quoted below)

The fact is, someone <del>was offended</del>[*][2] felt excluded by it. 

But you know what? That&#8217;s not the point. I&#8217;m sorry the prayer made Miss Ahlquist uncomfortable, but this won&#8217;t be the last time she <del>is offended</del>[*][2] feels excluded or uncomfortable with something she reads. We can&#8217;t decide public policy based on what <del>offends people</del>[*][2] makes people feel excluded.

Similarly, we cannot build public policy based on what ***doesn&#8217;t*** offend ***most*** people.

That&#8217;s the point! Public policy should not depend on the percentage of people offended by or uncomfortable with specific religous traditions. The United States was founded, in part, on the principles of religious freedom. Many people, including some atheists presumably, are not offended by or uncomfortable with the prayer. Some Christians, on the other hand, might be offended that the prayer does not end &#8220;in Jesus&#8217; name.&#8221;

So seriously, imagine a situation that puts you in the minority. How would you feel in that case?

Jessica Ahlquist put it very succinctly when [she said][3]

> It Ã­s almost like making a child get a shot even though they don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s for their own good. I feel like they might see it as a very negative thing right now, but I&#8217;m defending their Constitution, too. 

We might not see it that way, but she really is defending our religious freedom.

> Our Heavenly Father.  
> Grant us each day the desire to do our best.  
> To grow mentally and morally as well as physically.  
> To be kind and helpful to our classmates and teachers.  
> To be honest with ourselves as well as with others.  
> Help us to be good sports and smile when we lose as well as when we win.  
> Teach us the value of true friendship.  
> Help us always to conduct ourselves so as to bring credit to Cranston High School West.  
> Amen. 

<a name="offended">*</a> A commenter points out that Ms. Ahlquist was not offended by the prayer. In fact, she did state in depositions and interviews that she did NOT find the prayer offensive (though she did admit it made her feel excluded). I might argue that I was using the word offended differently than in the sense of finding something offensive, but I should have been more careful choosing my words. 

I think this makes my point stronger (albeit harder to read now). Even Ms. Ahlquist admits that the prayer is not offensive.
