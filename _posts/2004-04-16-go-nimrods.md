My son and I put together a [fantasy baseball][1] team every year on [Yahoo!][2] and we love it. We participate in a live online draft and then monitor the team all season. It&#8217;s a blast.Anyway, this season we&#8217;ve had a rough start. The past two seasons we spent in the top 3 in our league (12 teams). This season we have never broken above number 8! We are having trouble adjusting.Â After about an hour of reading some of my favorite Chrisitan websistes this morning, I stopped by Yahoo! to check on today&#8217;s lineup for the week and quickly became frustrated by the interface.Â They have changed it somewhat from last year and it annoys me. I click on &#8216;Opponents&#8217; to list the matches for the week. Then I select pitchers for today and click &#8216;Submit Changes.&#8217; It always brings me back to the default &#8216;Stats&#8217; view so I have to click &#8216;Opponents&#8217; again. Just a minor annoyance.Â I will be writing my own interface to solve this problem. I may not get to it until next weekend, but I will do it. Of course I may need to check the TOS at Yahoo! as it seems many sites are **banning scraping.** I have been reading on this topic a lot this week ([here][3] and [there][4] )and will post my thoughts on it soon. My gut reaction is &#8212; **You&#8217;ve got to be kidding! What&#8217;s next? You must read the newspaper in the living room, not the bathroom. No fast-forwarding through ads after you tape (or TiVO) something. (actually this has been debated already) I&#8217;m scraping and you can&#8217;t stop me!** That&#8217;s just my gut reaction. *I could be wrong. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
