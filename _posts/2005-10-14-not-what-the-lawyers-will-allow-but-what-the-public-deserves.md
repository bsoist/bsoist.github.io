President Bush promised to give us what we deserve.I guess now we know what he thinks of us, don&#8217;t we.

[Scandals Take Toll On Bush&#8217;s 2nd Term][1]

Great quotes from the article:  


> &#8220;It looks like a perfect storm,&#8221; said Joseph E. diGenova, a Republican and former independent counsel, who noted that so many investigations can weigh on an administration. &#8220;People have no idea what happens when an investigation gets underway. It&#8217;s debilitating. It&#8217;s not just distracting. It&#8217;s debilitating. It&#8217;s like getting punched in the stomach.&#8221;

> &#8220;The one that people are most worried about is Abramoff because it seems to have such long tentacles,&#8221;

> &#8220;The Abramoff thing is a lingering nuisance to everybody,&#8221; said GOP lobbyist Charles Black. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who else might be caught up in it.&#8221;

and my favorite:  

> The current atmosphere is not what Bush envisioned as a candidate in 2000.

Speaking of Abramoff. I think I remember [him][2].
