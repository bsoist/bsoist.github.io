This post is the eighth in a series. If you've just stumbled onto this series, you may want to start [here][1].

Today's topic is Young Earth Creationism or Creation Science.

I've started with this one because it's the easiest for me to dismiss. I am sure those who hold this view &#8211; they are many &#8211; will be disappointed to learn that I am not going to spend much time here.

Creation "science" is not science at all. I'll provide two reasons I say that.

### Dogma

> By definition, no apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information. <cite>Answers in Genesis <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/faith">statement of faith</a></cite>

You might believe that, and I take no issue with that &#8211; [but it's not science][2]

### Quote Mining
