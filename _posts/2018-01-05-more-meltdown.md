I just can't stop reading about this. 

I have a lot of thoughts, but not much to add to the conversation right now.

I am sharing some links I find today. You can see them via [my linkblog][links] (or [RSS][rsslinks]), but here is what I've share so far...

* [Meltdown Attack][fb]
* [Spectre Attack][ux]
* [12/20/17 - Linux users notice security patches and speculate][5p]
* [1/3/18 - There\s obviously a big problem, but we dont know exactly what.][80]
