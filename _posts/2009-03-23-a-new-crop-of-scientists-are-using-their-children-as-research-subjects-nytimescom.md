Apparently, some scientists use their own children as test subjects in the name of science.

> At a birthing class, Dr. Sinha, a neuroscience professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stunned everyone, including his wife, by saying he was excited about the babyâ€™s birth â€œbecause I really want to study him and do experiments with him.â€ He did, too, strapping a camera on baby Dariusâ€™s head, recording what he looked at.

I love science as much as anyone, but this is very disturbing to me. Does anyone NOT see an ethical issue here?
