I&#8217;v seen a few posts, including [this one][1], regarding the results of Terri Schiavo&#8217;s autopsy and the appropriateness of an apology to her husband.This was a sensitive issue and I don&#8217;t pretend to know what the right things to do and say are, BUT I think many people owe this man an apology regardless of what the autopsy &#8216;proves.&#8217;Am I the only one to think this way?
