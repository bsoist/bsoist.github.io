This is actually the one quality I really like about Bush &#8211; his &#8220;stubborn confidence in his own judgement.&#8221;  


> &#8220;I know her. I know her heart. I know what she believes,&#8221; said the president last week, after he nominated Miers to the United States Supreme Court. &#8220;I know her well enough to be able to say that she&#8217;s not going to change, that 20 years from now she&#8217;ll be the same person with the same philosophy that she is today.&#8221;In other words: trust me. For a president under attack recently for staffing his government with hacks and cronies, the appointment of his personal lawyerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âwho has never judged a day in her lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âto the nation&#8217;s highest court showed a certain stubborn confidence in his own judgment.<cite><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9629611/site/newsweek/">Mild About Harriet &#8211; Newsweek National News &#8211; MSNBC.com</a></cite></p>
