On Saturday I finished reading an interesting post at *Thinking Christian*. It was the latest in a [seven part series][1] covering Intelligent Design and Creationism. I don&#8217;t agree with everything the author states but he does a great job laying out what he believes to be the difference between the two movements and in some respects he is &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; (he may even state as much in one of his comments). After reviewing the entire series again and a few other articles on the same topic, I am now more certain than ever that Intelligent Design has no place in a science classroom &#8211; even in a Christian school.

If you&#8217;re not familiar with my background, I attended a fundamentalist Christian high school where we were taught the tenets of Young-Earth Creationism. I never really accepted all of that but I do believe in the personal God of the Bible and in His plan for my redemption. I also believe that the universe was brought into existence by God via the big bang and that what we see today is a result of billions of years of evolution since that time. I have no problem with the theory of common descent. As a matter of fact, I see a lot of majesty in the process of evolution &#8211; but more on that Wednesday (or later). 

Don&#8217;t discount me as a creationist kook. I&#8217;ve said for years that I am not. I happen to believe wholeheartedly in God but not because I can&#8217;t explain the universe. I have a lot more to say about this series and the topic in general. I will try to get my thoughts together for an essay to be published Wednesday, but for now I wanted to share some links.

## Are ID and Creationism the Same Thing?

The author makes a great case that they are not, but my problem is that many Young-Earthers claim ID as their movement. This is a huge problem in my mind. As usual, Dr. David Heddle skillfully states my position better than I can [here][2].

## Is ID Science, Religion, or Something Else?

Another author [points out][3] that the ID movement is a political movement and I have to agree.

## So, Science or Not?

Some readers won&#8217;t find [this article][4] as funny as I did, but it really does drive home the point that ID is not science.
