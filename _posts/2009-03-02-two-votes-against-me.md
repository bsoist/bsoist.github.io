This is [one of those stories][1] I just can&#8217;t believe.

Big guy forces the little guy out of business. Little guy sues. Big guy, forced to pay $50 million, vows to appeal and spends $3 million to help elect a judge. Then he appeals and wins.

I simply can&#8217;t believe that anyone thinks this is how things should work &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe it.

Andrew L. Frey, attorney for Don Blankenship (the big guy) posed a few interesting questions but I think they are all easy answers.

> Should a judge sit on a case involving a newspaper that endorsed his campaign?

Yes.

> Is recusal necessary when one party is an interest group that worked for the judge&#8217;s election?

Yes.

> If the justice Blankenship worked so hard to oust had been reelected, would he harbor such animus that he should recuse himself from the case?

Probably, yes.

Am I the only one who thinks these are not difficult ethical questions?
