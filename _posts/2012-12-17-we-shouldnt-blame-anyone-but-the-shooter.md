I was sickened over the news of the tragedy on Friday.

I was also sickened by the response of some Christians.

Of course the kooks were talking about protesting the funerals, etc, but I’m talking about people who should have known better. Specifically, Mike Huckabee, a man who came dangerously close to becoming the Presdident of the United States.

Mr. Huckabee started by blaming the shooting on our “…systematically removing God from our schools.” ([youtube link][1]) I assume that after he realized that religious schools, and even churches, are not exempt from these kinds of tragedies &#8211; remember the Amish schoolhouse, Mike? &#8211; he decided instead to blame it on Obamacare. ([youtube link][2])

He is not the only one saying things like this. Bryan Fischer said that God could have protected the children but didn’t because He “is not giong to go where He is not wanted.” ([youtube link][3]) Aside from the fact that these shootings have happened in religouis schools, this is a ridiculous thing to say about God. God most certainly goes where He is unwanted. He does it all the time.

Both of these men should have taken cues from Albert Mohler. Dr. Mohler and I disagree on a good many things, and he has been known to mix his politics and religion before, but he offered what I consider a [thoughtful and reasonable statement][4]. More importantly, he was trying to be constructive. The only one to blame here is the shooter.
