I've been thinking for some time - years, really - about how to use only [free software]. This is a cause I've cared aobut for a long time and every once in a while I get carried away thinking I can go "cold turkey" and just get rid of all of the non-free software in my life. 

I saw an article recently about the evils of Google. The article had a link to a page called "No More Google" which showcased software one could use to replace the services Google provides. My obsession kicked in again. I decided I would completely give up on Google. I have several of my own email domains for which I use Google Apps. That will be a big deal to give up, but aside from that, giving up Google won't be nearly as hard for me as it might be for others.[^1] 

Of course, I couldn't leave well-enough alone. So, I started planning to get rid of all non-free software. 

The last time I went down this rabbit-hole, the biggest sticking point for me was using Dropbox. Now, though I still use it, it's mosly for support files for apps and such, so I could give it up. But what about OneDrive and iCloud? I also use more non-free apps than I did back then and I really like some of them. I believe I could give all of them up - except maybe Slack.

But while I'm headed down this road... why not take it one step more. I've been reading and learning about building apps on the blockchain for some time now and a short while ago I started following and fiddling with Dapps. Why not go ALL Dapps! Right?

Wrong!

See, this is how my brain works. I have to stop myself, take a deep breath and remind myself not to let the perfect get in the way of the good. 

One step at a time.

Here's the thing, though, I tend to use that as an excuse to not take any action at all. If I can't go all Dapps or all non-free or all non-Google or whatever, why make any changes at all. I really like the software experience I've created for myself. Why make any change if I can't make them all?

I want to stop letting my mind play these tricks on me.

So, I want to start looking into alternative apps - Dapps when possible - one at a time and just see where that takes me.

I plan to document all of this here in case you're interested in following along.
