> How far would you go to get your answers?

I am not much for alien films, but I love alternate realities and big philosophical questions. This film is about those questions. Ridley Scott once again tells a story in a series of fantastic images, supported by the perfect cast. Fassbender and Rapace turn in the best performances by far, if you ask me. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The last shot was especially great for me. It reminded me of the scene in *The Phantom Menace* when R2-D2 and C-3PO meet for the first time. Great stuff!

I&#8217;ve seen this film several times and I am always left with the same impression. A story with such a brilliant premise should have it&#8217;s resolution in something more interesting than standard action movie nonsense. I love the idea of this film, but not the film itself.

> I have a&#8230; financial problem. A shortfall.

A very good film I had never heard of before. Phillip Seymour Hoffman expertly portrays a banker who has a serious gambling problem in this film based on the true story. Minnie Driver and John Hurt also turn in fantastic performances. This film is not for everyone, but the acting is superb.
