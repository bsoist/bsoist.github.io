Today I&#8217;ve decided to back an art project entitled [Left Behind: Life and Death Along the Arizona Border][1] which documents illegal immigration along the Arizona border.

From the project page &#8230;

> This book is important for a number of reasons. It is a way of humanizing the immigration issue we face in our country. It points to how desperate the individuals are to escape whatever their circumstances were and start a new life. Essentially this books stands as a kind of memorial to people who died alone, without ceremony and who often are still unknown.

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
