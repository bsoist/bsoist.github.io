On Friday, I posted that I would start doing some fun stuff on Fridays on my blog. One of the things I mentioned was Hair Metal Friday. The idea was inspired by my favorite room at TurntableFM &#8211; [hair metal fridays @ bracketlabs][1]

I&#8217;ve decided to change things up and make this a Monday feature. I&#8217;m not ready to commit to doing it every week, but I suspect I will want to do it more often than Fridays will allow. Monday works best in my schedule for a lot of reasons.

So, we&#8217;ll kick off Hair Metal Mondays with the song I posted on Friday &#8211; *Something to Believe In* by Poison.

Poison is the quintessential hair metal band, and this song is one of my favorite songs of all time. The story goes that Bret Michaels received a call on Christmas Eve 1990 and was told his best friend, a Poison bodyguard, had died alone in his Palm Springs hotel room. Friends say went into hysterics and locked himself in his hotel room until he finished this song. The song also touches on other issues &#8211; a Vietnam vet struggling with his time at war and his reception at home ( believed to be inspired by one of Bret&#8217;s cousins ), televangelists ( Jim Bakker is shown in the video ), and the gap between the rich and the poor. 

Like any man my age, all of the issues are familiar to me, but the song really hits home for me in the first and last verses. The disparity between the rich and the poor, and the degree to which the rich take advantage of the poor &#8211; even in the name of God &#8211; is something I will never be able to comprehend.



<pre>Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promise lands
He tells me believe in Jesus
Steals the money from my hands

Some say he was a good man
Lord I think he sinned, yeah

Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back

Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget

He cried "Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did"

Chorus:
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news

I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place

And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

Chorus

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home

Solo

I drive by the homeless sleeping on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read Jesus Saves

A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich drinkin' from a golden cup

And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, and so few win

Chorus

You take the high road
And I'll take the low road

Yes Sometimes I wish I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then

And give me something to believe in, yeah
</pre>
