In a [ previous post][1] I rambled on about my own personal search for the right way to manage the RSS feeds I want to read. Regular readers will remember a similar [posts about link managers][2].<!--more-->Today, I wanted to follow up with a quick review of the three readers I&#8217;ve used the most &#8211; 

[Bloglines][3], [Rojo][4], and [Google Reader][5].  


### Bloglines

Keyboard shortcuts Folders &#8211; I know many people prefer tags. They make sense for content that is saved mostly for searching, but I like folders for this kind of content. Feed and folder centered reading &#8211; I want to read a specific blog or topic. I don&#8217;t need the entries lumped together and sorted by some other means (like date). Adequate import/export

### Rojo

No keyboard shortcuts Nice social features &#8211; contacts, etc. Tags &#8211; I don&#8217;t like these for this kind of content Post centered reading &#8211; I don&#8217;t like this for blogs, but for news it makes great sense. I **do** want all the content lumped together and sorted by date (most of the time). Adequate import/export

### Google Reader

Keyboard shortcuts Post centered reading &#8211; so I could use it for news Tags &#8211; still don&#8217;t like &#8216;em Adequate import. Never checked for export.

In my [previous post][1] I mentioned two problems that compelled me to give up on Google&#8217;s effort. The first is my inability to find a way to easily delete feeds, or more specifically, groups of feeds (in my case &#8211; all my feeds). After importing my OPML to see how this app worked, I wanted to remove all feeds and &#8220;start over.&#8221; My inability to find a way to delete feeds was a huge problem at that point.The other problem is more specific to my needs but I wanted to be complete. I do most of my reading on my laptop. My eyesight is not sharp. I use CTRL-+ to increase the font size while I read. I frequently use this key combination 3 or more times. When I did this with Google Reader, I found it confusing because it was not clear which post I was reading and which was next (try it to see what I mean).\*These two problems were dealbreakers for me.\*note- adjusting my lcd is not an option. I use my laptop at my desk and connect to a 21 inch monitor most of the workday and would need to adjust back and forth too much.
