On Thursday, I [reviewed][1] the special edition graphic novel which I loved.

The movie, on the other hand, was a real disappointment.

I couldn&#8217;t wait to see the movie. I&#8217;d actually only read the book to prepare for the film. After reading the book, I was curious to see how the screenplay would handle some of the more difficult parts of the book. One of the books characters lives outside of time as we know it and I thought that alone would be a problem. I was very disappointed to learn that the screenplay &#8220;handled&#8221; these things by simply using narration.

That was just one of the disappointing features. You&#8217;ve heard the rest from others probably. The movie is very self-indulgent. It has much more nudity than necessary (the book had plenty to make the points), and the ending was re-written. Even the special effects did not justify the price of admission to the big screen in my opinion.

If you&#8217;re a fan of the movie, you may want to pick up the Blu-ray or DVD. If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie, don&#8217;t bother with the theater. Spend your $10 on a better film.
