About six months ago, I decided to change my &#8220;Political Views&#8221; on Facebook from Libertarian to Libertarian Socialist. Watching the social network last week got me thinking about this again &#8211; so I changed it. What follows is my attempt to explain why &#8211; as briefly as I know how.

I labeled myself a libertarian almost twenty years ago. Even at that time there were two kinds of libertarians &#8211; traditional libertarians and the right-leaning variety popular in the U.S. Since neither was very popular in my circles at the time, I simply explained to my friends that I was a libertarian without the capital L. That was my way of disassociating with the hyper-capitalists. 

The term &#8220;libertarian&#8221; is now becoming synonymous with the &#8220;tea party&#8221; in this country. Unfortunately, the tea party movement and others like it are anything but libertarian. It has now become necessary to make a stronger distinction. I&#8217;ve written about the tea party before and I don&#8217;t want to be associated with them in any way. 

I know some of you are going to be thoroughly confused that I would choose to &#8220;admit&#8221; to being a socialist in order to avoid being labeled a &#8220;hyper capitalist&#8221; since most people equate socialism with state-socialism. In addition, libertarian socialists disagree on a great deal of important issues. I welcome that ambiguity. I am just growing tired of being labeled &#8220;one of those tea party guys.&#8221;

Stay tuned. This post actually grew into a series of posts which I will publish in the coming weeks.
