I grew up about 90 miles from where I live now. I spent a total of about 28 years living very close to that area, and I've lived another 15 years here.

I was talking to a friend who has spent most of his life in thie area too - longer than I.

I haven't looked it up, but neither of us can remeber a time when it was this cold for this long at once.

I don't get cold easily, but this is pretty stinkin' cold. 

I might have to rethink moving further north. :)
