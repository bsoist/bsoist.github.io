"See, this is the meaning of life," I said to Becky.

Becky was enjoying playing in the yard and watching Billy and I have our almost daily catch.

"What is?" she said.

"Throwing the baseball around in the spring."

"No it's not, Dad!"

"Well, what is?"

"Praising God is the meaning of life."

Thanks Becky for once again teaching your dad a lesson about life!
