I had a lot of catching up to do when this year&#8217;s nominees were announced, but I&#8217;ve recovered nicely. I have seen 40 of the 53 films nominated this year, and I&#8217;ve seen every entry in 15 of the 24 categories. Unfortunately, I missed a couple of films I really should have seen. Most notably, *Amour*, *The Impossible*, and *The Master*.

I&#8217;ve listed the &#8220;glamour&#8221; categories toward the end, and I&#8217;ve ordered the others based on my understanding of the category ( with the stuff I know least first ). I&#8217;ve commented on most of the categories, but not all.

<div>
  <h3>
    Makeup and Hairstyling
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 2/3,<br /> Not Seen: <em>Hitchcock</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>The Hobbit</em>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Costume Design
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Mirror Mirror</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All five nominees deserve recognition in this category. Les Mis was the weakest, if you ask me, and that is saying something.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Original Song
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 3/5,<br /> Not Seen: but I&#8217;ve heard all the songs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Skyfall</em>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Original Score
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Life of Pi</em>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Sound Editing
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Django Unchained</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Argo</em> and <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> were very well done.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Sound Mixing
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Les Miserables</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I heard so much about how they were to record the actors actually singing during the performances. I didn&#8217;t believe it was possible and I couldn&#8217;t wait to see it. It was brilliantly done.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Production Design
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Anna Karenina</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The other nominees were well done, but <em>Anna Karenina</em> was far and away the best in my opinion.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Visual Effects
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Avengers</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I wasn&#8217;t particularly wowed by any of these.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Film Editing
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An important film that I did not enjoy watching. Editing was the part.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Animated Feature
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 4/5,<br /> Not Seen: <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Frankenweenie</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was disappointed I didn&#8217;t get to see <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, but I can&#8217;t imagine it beats the other four. I enjoyed all of them very much.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Live Action Short
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Henry</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A strange mix this year. <em>Henry</em> is a heart &#8211; wrenching tale of an elderly man clinging desperately to his memories.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Animated Short
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Head over Heels</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It seems every year my favorite is a love story. This year there were three, but this one was my favorite.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Documentary Short
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Inocente</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All of these were good, but two stand out far and above the others. <em>Inocente</em> is a wonderful story about how art can save lives! Highly, highly recommended! <em>Mondays at Racine</em> was a moving story about two women giving their time and talent to help cancer patients feel beautiful.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Documentary Feature
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 4/5,<br /> Not Seen: <em>The Gatekeepers</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Searching for Sugar Man</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t care which one was a better documentary. This one was a fantastic, fun story.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Cinematography
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Anna Karenina</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another category where this movie rises above other very worthy nominees.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Directing
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; Ben Affleck <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Ang Lee
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ang Lee is the man, but Ben Affleck was robbed. That is all.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Adapted Screenplay
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Lincoln</em>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Original Screenplay
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 5/5,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was one of the best films of the year, if you ask me. Should have been nominated for much more.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Supporting Actor
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 4/5,<br /> Not Seen: <em>The Master</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; Christoph Waltz
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Brilliant once again, but the others &#8211; Jones especially &#8211; were very good. I didn&#8217;t see <em>The Master</em>, but I&#8217;m guessing Hoffman was excellent.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Supporting Actress
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 3/5,<br /> Not Seen: <em>The Master</em>, <em>The Sessions</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; Sally Field
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I only saw three of these, but I thought Field played Mary Todd brilliantly. Weaver also expertly played a character that is difficult to play with the appropriate subtleties.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Actor
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 4/5,<br /> Not Seen: <em>The Master</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; Daniel Day-Lewis
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Phoenix was the only performance I missed, but I&#8217;ve heard it was best. Day-Lewis was the best of those I saw.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Actress
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 3/5,<br /> Not Seen: Amour, <em>The Impossible</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; Jennifer Lawrence
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m disappointed I didn&#8217;t see Watts&#8217; performance. I think she is always excellent, and I think she has been snubbed several times. I&#8217;ve heard Riva was brilliant. Having only seen three, my choice would have to be Lawrence. Chastain was good. Wallis was delightful and adorable. I&#8217;d like to see her in a role where there is less narration and more acting.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Best Picture
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Seen: 8/9,<br /> Not Seen: Amour
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My Pick &#8211; <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is my kind of film. Highly Recommended!
