We like to play games at our house.
I don't remember exactly when this started, but at some point we started buying one board game for Billy and one for Becky for Christmas every year, and we enjoyed playing the games together on Christmas day. Like most toys you get your kids for Christmas, they would go unused for most of the next year, but every once in a while we hit on one we all really liked. 
I remember one year we considered not getting them because it seemed like the price on games had jumped dramatically, but we realized that a few hours of family of fun was certainly worth a few dollars. I am very glad we did because we've continued this tradition almost every year since. Even as Billy and Becky got older and started to have more expensive gifts, we had Gram and Grandad get the games for them.
At some point Becky really started to get into board games and we started spending more time playing as a family. Now it's a running joke with my brother and sister that they have to buy a new game every time they come to our house because their kids love the games we play when they are here. 
This year, Becky's gift from Gram and Grandad was <em>Takenoko</em>. It's a blast and we've played every day since Christmas - most days more than once. 
Billy got an Xbox One this year and he and I have been playing through <em>The Master Chief Collection</em> on legendary difficulty. I've played through in single player on legendary before, but we are having a great time doing it together.
