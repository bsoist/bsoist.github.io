I learned a few things during 2010. Here are just four &#8230;

## Things Aren&#8217;t Always As They Seem {#things_aren8217t_always_as_they_seem}

No matter how things appear, the reality may be much different. While you are enjoying your life, that reality might just unexpectedly rear its head and smack you silly. And speaking of enjoying life &#8230;

## Life Is Hard {#life_is_hard}

Terri and I used to talk about how wonderful our lives were. So many people struggle with so many things and we&#8217;ve always been so blessed. This year I have seen first hand some of the difficulties other people face. We are still blessed in a big way but I understand better now what people deal with. 

## I Need to Play More Video Games {#i_need_to_play_more_video_games}

I stopped playing video games regularly about twenty years ago. Since then video games have been mostly a family event. One of my projects this year reminded me that I enjoy playing certain types of games. So I am playing again.

## My Kids Are Growing Up {#my_kids_are_growing_up}

This is the hardest lesson I learned all year. 

Billy is young for a senior so everything hit us at once. He spent six weeks in Germany as an exchange student. He went to England by himself for his interviews at Oxford. He has his own work, drives everywhere by himself, and all of a sudden he is an adult. We were looking through our photo library the other day and I couldn&#8217;t get past all the photos of Billy from just the last few years where he still looks like a little boy. That boy is now a young man. 

When I began writing this, Becky was making me a birthday cheesecake from scratch all by herself. She also made almost all of our Christmas cookies by herself this year. She makes dinner for the family from time to time and yesterday she was teaching me how to do something in Photoshop. She is growing into a brilliant and beautiful young woman. 

The cheesecake was wonderful, by the way.
