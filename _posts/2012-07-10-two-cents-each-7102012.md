Since I stopped doing this updates weekly, it bails me out when I don&#8217;t know what else to post. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

[The Medium &#8211; Beep! &#8211; NYTimes.com][1]
:   A fun read about a great sound and a great word.

[Amazon: You Need To Change Your Idiotic Customer Reviews Policy Right Now][2]
:   I don't like that some authors withhold the Kindle version, but this is not the appropriate way to respond.

[Shut Up & Bring It | Talking Points Memo][3]
:   Yeah!

[Patent troll stalks travel site Hipmunk â€” Tech News and Analysis][4]
:   &#34;firms that donâ€™t make anything collect patents in order to extract licensing settlements from companies that do.&#34; Exactly!

[Hodges now leery of Jindal reform][5]
:   You see? This is what is wrong with the merging of state and church. This is exactly it. She doesn't want government funded radical Islamist schools, and I don't want government funded radical fundamentalist Christian schools.

[New SBC President Supports LifeWay's 'The Blind Side' Removal][6]
:   There has been a lot of controversy on this one. I understand both sides of the argument. On the one hand, I think dismissing the movie as unfit for viewing by Christians is a ridiculous position. On the other, LifeWay has a right to sell what it wants and refuse to sell certain items. The bigger question is how the church thinks it can reach society with relevant messages when the media they support is not relevant. I'll probably have a lot more to say about this later.

[The Consumerist Â» Am I Supposed To Tip At An Event With An Open Bar?][7]
:   I always tip anyone who relies on tips for a living. I think sometimes we think too much about whether the server is being overtipped. I refuse to look at it that way. If I were drinking at an open bar, I would tip what I always tip &#8211; because I can afford to, it's a nice thing to do, and most importantly, because the person serving deserves to be paid for his or her work. If the bartender ends up with twice as much somehow, why should that bother me? A few drinks for a few bucks is a great deal. Enjoy it. If the bartender goes home with a few extra bucks, that's even better if you ask me.
