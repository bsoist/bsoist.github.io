In 2009, I decided to post something in honor of Dr. King every year on the official holiday. 

Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve discovered several websites dedicated to the life and work of Dr. King. I&#8217;ve also learned that many others have written much more eloquently than I, so this year I thought I&#8217;d change things up and post a roundup of links. 

My exploration this morning brought me to a website that I&#8217;ve actually never used before and I discovered that many of the sites I was going to share are compiled in an excellent list over at [Bing&#8217;s Editor&#8217;s Picks][1].

It also occurred to me that since only three of you read what I posted in previous years, I might want to include those links here.

  * [Martin Luther King, Jr. &#8211; The Extremist][2]
  * [King&#8217;s Other Dream][2]
  * [Songs Inspired by MLK][3]

The rest of these links point to content I&#8217;ve shared elsewhere today or plan to share later today. 

  * [I&#8217;m Human][4]
  * [A Rubik&#8217;s Cubes Mosaic of Martin Luther King, Jr.][5]
  * [25 Retweetable #MLK Quotes][6]
  * [Straight up][7]
  * [Keeping King&#8217;s Spiritual Vision Alive][8]
  * [What would Martin Luther King Jr. say to Occupy Wall Street?][9]
  * [Interfaith cooperation on campus and the legacy of MLK][10]
  * [Dr. King&#8217;s Favorite Song][11]
  * [For MLK Day, free admission to national parks][12]
  * [Memories of MLK][13]
  * [Unveiling MLK][14]
