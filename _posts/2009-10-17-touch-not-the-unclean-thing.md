I was trying to think of a movies I&#8217;ve seen that are related to the topic of peace. I thought of some of the obvious examples, like Ghandi, but the one I remember having a big impact on my thinking was Witness. It was released almost 25 years ago so those of you that haven&#8217;t seen it may not be planning on it, but I&#8217;m not going to spoil the ending for you because you should definitely watch it.

I saw this in college in a theater full of violence loving students and I&#8217;m afraid they mostly missed the point. With Harrison Ford as the lead, I&#8217;m assuming that most Americans missed the point too. Pay attention to the real message.
