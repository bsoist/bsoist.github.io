As I wrote [last year][1], I was never a fan of April Fools until the Internet jokes started. Now I look forward to it every year. This is the kind of gag I think this day was made for. [That one above][2] was my favorite April Fools gag this year by a long shot.

It came as no surprise to me that Google turned in the best of the year in my opinion. They actually had quite a few good ones this year (listed below), but there were some other nice gags.

[Seth Godin&#8217;s contribution][3] was very funny and actually makes a bigger point. Reminds me of something Mark Cuban posted years ago (though that was not an April Fools gag).

[Richard Branson&#8217;s entry][4] is great stuff.

As usual, ThinkGeek turns [announces a great new product][5].



The rest by Google &#8230;

  * Nigeria &#8211; you&#8217;ve got to [see this one][6] to appreciate it (the warning is bogus)
  * Google and Nascar Team Up &#8211; [great video at nascar.com][7]
  * Gmail Tap &#8211; [link][8]  
    
  * Chrome Multitask Mode &#8211; [link][9]  
    
  * Click-to-Teleport &#8211; [a whole new way to drive in-store sales][10]
  * The YouTube Collection &#8211; ALL of YouTube on [DVD][11]!
  * Really Advanced Search &#8211; [a few amusing options added][12]
  * Australia &#8211; [Street Roo][13]
  * China &#8211; [underwater search][14]
