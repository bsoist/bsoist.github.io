A while back I saved a few links to cool JavaScript clocks. I just ran into them again today and I thought I&#8217;d share.

One of them is Flash but I&#8217;ll include that too since it&#8217;s very cool.

  * [Customizable JavaScript Clock][1] 
    
      * [My Favorite][2] 
        
          * [Simple Clock][3] 
            
              * [The Flash Clock][4]
