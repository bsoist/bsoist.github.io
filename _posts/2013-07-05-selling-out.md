I know of many artists, including writers, actors, etc, who wait tables or wash dishes or do all sorts of other jobs to support themselves so that they can pursue their art. While I admire that kind of dedication to one&#8217;s art, I don&#8217;t understand why some of these artists resist using their art as a craft to support them financially.

I&#8217;m not talking about making the big time &#8211; closing a million dollar deal on a novel or landing a part in a broadway show, for example &#8211; some of them are hoping that will happen some day. I&#8217;m talking about selling work now, to clients, for money. I&#8217;m talking about a comic book artist who designs logos for clients, or a writer who writes advertising copy.

Again, I&#8217;m sure some would actively welcome gigs like that, but I know some artists think of this as &#8220;selling out.&#8221;

And I don&#8217;t get that.

No doubt, if I were writing a screenplay, I might get a job waiting tables or tending bar. The material alone would probably be worth it. What a great way to come up with ideas for characters, right? No doubt I met a lot of characters when I was in the restaurant business, but I wouldn&#8217;t be against selling my work for money &#8211; as long as I didn&#8217;t have to compromise the work itself.

I guess that&#8217;s what most of us fear. I understand avoiding situations which might require compromising one&#8217;s values. I probably wouldn&#8217;t take a job at an advertising firm, for example, if I could not be in charge of the kind of copy I would be asked to write. Freelance work, on the other hand, provides a certain amount of control. This, of course, comes with the challenge of resisting compromise over and over again, one job offer at a time, but if you ask me I think any artist who wants to &#8220;stick to her guns&#8221; should be able to handle that and at least supplement her income using her skills.
