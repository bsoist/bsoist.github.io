When I was in second grade, my friends and I used to use a secret cypher for passing messages to one another. The way I remember it, it was very simple, but only **we** knew how it worked.

What is it about keeping secrets?

The informaation we were keeping to ourselves was not anything that needed to be kept secret. There was no abuse or bullies or anything like that. There was only one reason we did what we did - we just liked keeping things just for us.
It was so much fun. Even now, more than forty years later, thinking of it brings a smile to my face.
