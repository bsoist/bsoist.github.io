I recently found myself in another debate about the age of the earth, and it occurred to me that I should write a series of blog posts on the subject.

I know some who think the debate isn&#8217;t worth having, but I disagree. I agree with fellow Christians that it&#8217;s not an essential &#8220;salvation issue&#8221; but I think it does raise questions &#8211; important ones &#8211; about the nature of reality, the reliability of science, and our ability to believe or know anything. 

I know some will think I&#8217;m overstating it, but I firmly believe the debate over the Earth&#8217;s age is a symptom of a bigger problem. 

So, I&#8217;ve decided to post weekly on a topic related to science and religion. Right now I plan to do these in series, with the first being about the age of the Earth. Obviously, I may stray into other issues of faith and practice &#8211; politics, economics, ethics, etc. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.

I haven&#8217;t decided on a particular day for this, but he plan for someday next week is &#8220;Possible Interpretations for Genesis Chapter One&#8221; (and maybe I&#8217;ll do chapter two also).
