I did not have a movie review queued up for this week, but I was inspired by my web notes today to review a movie I saw a long time ago. 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QS9TX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003QS9TX2&linkCode=as2&tag=weifyoasme-20&linkId=43USFHPYO4XQPRJB">Unbreakable</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003QS9TX2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a film about two men. One, an average Joe with one very unusual quality. He never gets sick or injured. The other, exactly the opposite. He is far from normal or average, and he breaks all the time.

Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular in his role as Elijah Price, aka Mr. Glass, and the film is full of suspense and drama. Shyamalan's best movie by a long shot if you ask me.
