It's time once again for the Oscars and, as usual, I am going to share my opinions on the nominations, my projections for the winners, and our menu for viewing.
First, the menu ...
	As I mentioned last year, our household turned vegetarian sometime after the 2012 Oscars, so putthing a film inspired menu together is a bit of a challenge. This year, the food was all over the place, and it's just three of us, so we opted to make it an all day menu. ( Actually, our diets are all a little different - Terri is pescatarian, Becky vegetarian, and I am *mostly* vegan but I eat cheese and eggs occasionally - but we wanted food we would all eat today. 
	For breakfast, we had omelettes in honor of Philomena.
	For lunch, we had baked beans in honor of Captain Phillips, a native of bean town. We found a great recipe online for squash, spinach, and feta samosas, but we didn't have then energy to put those together.
	We have one movie to watch yet, so we are having popcorn in honor of Nebraska - and we cooked it in the science oven in honor of American Hustle. 
	For dinner we will have Mac and Cheese in honor of Her - something we imagine a bachelor might have for dinner. We are pretty sick of pizza and we love making cupcakes, but not eathing them so much. :)
	Snacks and dessert for the show - Texas Caviar ( Dallas Buyers Club ), Moon Pies ( Gravity ), Creampuffs ( The Wolf of Wall Street ), and Blackberry Cobbler ( 12 Years a Slave - in honor of his blackberry ink ).
	Meat eaters might want to add steak ( Dallas Buyers Club ), clams casino ( American Hustle ), and Lobster ( The Wolf of Wall Street ).
	For those of you that drink, you might want to include the following ( click on each if you can't guess what movie they match ).

The Nominations
	I thought there were a few surprises this year.
	There was a lot of talk about Jennifer Lawrence being a bogus nomination, but I disagree. I know I'm biased, loving Lawrence like I do, but I saw the film twice and I think her performace was worthy of a nomination. I actually think she might win.
	Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, and Robert Redford turned in fantastic acting performances this year. I'm not sure if their performances warrant bumping someone out of nominations, but they deserve notice.
	Julie Delpy should have been nominated. This is a hard category, but I think her perfomance was as good as any of the nominees. If I had to drop someone, it would be Meryl Streep ( and not just because I love Amy and Sandy ).
	I also thought Before Midnight deserved more than the single nomination it received.
	I was sorry to see ZERO nominations for Fruitvale Station. The movie had some flaws, but it deserved notice.
	I didn't see Inside Llewyn Davis, but people who did seem surprised it wasn't nominated. 
	I've listed some other possible snubs below.
The Winners
	I saw American Hustle twice and I think it could be the big winner this year. I think the Academy might be ready to give the high honors to a fun film for a change.
	Click on the categories below to see my choices and preditions. The order is based on <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/is-this-the-order-and-timing-for-tonights-oscars">someone else's predictions</a>. I've listed the ratio of seen/unseen for all the categories.
		Actor in a Supporting Role - 4/5
			I really like Cooper and Hill, but I didn't see Hill's performance and I feel like I've seen Cooper do this before. 
			My choice - Jared Leto
			Prediction - Jared Lito
			The other two were fantastic.
		Animated Short Film
			This is the first year in many that I've actually liked all five. I also liked the highly commended choices. 
			I thought it was interested that all of these were about isolation on some level.
			My Choice - Mr. Hublot
			Prediction - Get a Horse
			Possessions was brilliant too!
		Animated Feature Film - 2/5
			I've only seen two of these, and I don't typically like the Disney movies, but I think Frozen was fantastic. 
			My Choice - Frozen
			Prediction - Frozen
		Cinematography - 2/5
			I've only seen two of these - Gravity and Nebraska.
			My Choice - Nebraska
			Prediction - Gravity
			Snub? - 12 Years a Slave
		Visual Effects - 4/5
			My Choice - Gravity
			Prediction - Gravity
		Costume Design - 2/5
			My Choice - American Hustle
			Prediction - American Hustle
		Make Up and Hair Styling - 2/3
			Jackass seems to be the favorite and I didn't see it, so my choice has to be Dallas Buyers Club.
			My Choice - Dallas Buyers Club
			Prediction - Jackass
			Snub? - American Hustle
		Live Action Short Film
			I liked all of these very much for very different reasons, but one of them was an almost perfect short film.
			My Choice - Just Before Losing Everything 
			Prediction - The Voorman Problem
			To be clear, my choice is the perfect one. :)
		Documentary Short Subject
			All of the animated films were about isolation. All of these were about forgiveness in some way. And they were all very powerful films.
			My Choice - The Lady in Number 6
			Prediction - The Lady in Number 6
		Sound Mixing - 3/5
			My Choice - Gravity
			Prediction - Gravity
		Sound Editing - 4/5
			My Choice - Gravity
			Prediction - Gravity
		Actress in a Supporting Role - 5/5 
			All of these were fantastic performances, but one of them was certainly the best. 
			My Choice - Lupita Nyong'o
			Prediction - Lupita Nyong'o
		Film Editing - 5/5
			American Hustle had many technical flaws, and editing was the worst. In my opinion, it should not have been nominated. Any of the others could win.
			My Choice - Gravity
			Prediction - Gravity
		Production Design - 3/5
			My Choice - American Hustle
			Prediction - Gasby
		Original Score - 3/5
			My Choice - Gravity
			Prediction - Gravity
		Original Song - 4/4
			My Choice - Let it Go
			Prediction - Let it Go
		Adapted Screenplay - 4/5
			My Choice - Before Midnight
			Prediction - 12 Years a Slave
			I still disagree with sequels being considered adapted.
		Original Screenplay - 4/5
			My Choice - Her
		Directing - 4/5
			My Choice - Steve McQueen
			Prediction - Cuaroin 
		Actress in a Leading Role - 5/5
			My Choice - Adams
			Prediction - Blanchet
		Actor in a Leading Role - 4/5
			This is a tough one for me. When I first saw Bale in Hustle I had a hard time thinking anyone could have done better, but they were all fantastic this year. 
			My Choice - McConaughey
			Prediction - McConaughey
		Best Picture - 7/9
			Tough category this year. I saw seven of these and most deserve a win. And I'm sure the other two are contenders.
			My Choice - 12 Years a Slave ( though I would be thrilled if American Hustle wins )
			Prediction - Gravity
