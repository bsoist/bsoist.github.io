I&#8217;ve joined a book club.

I figured that since I never have anything to do, I would sign up. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Anyway, our first book is [Confessions of an Economic Hit Man][1]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0452287081" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and I have found it fascinating. While the details in the book are not really a surprise to me (I&#8217;ve assumed this kind of thing was happening), it does seem a little hard to believe the way the story unfolds.

I will get back to you when I am finished.
