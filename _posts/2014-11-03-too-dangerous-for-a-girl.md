This is something we talk a lot about at our house, but the "throw like a girl" <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/mone-davis-back-throw-girl-chevrolet-commercial/story?id=26370923">commercial featuring Mo'ne Davis</a> got me thinking a lot more about this recently.
I still hear people saying that girls shouldn't be allowed to play baseball with the boys.
I'm willing to have a reasoned debate about the pros and cons, there is one argument I cannot handle - "it's too dangerous"
If it's too dangerous girls, maybe it's too dangerous. Period.
