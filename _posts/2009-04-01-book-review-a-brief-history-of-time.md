Twenty-one years ago today a masterpiece was published.

In *A Brief History of Time*, Stephen Hawking attempts the impossible. His mission is to explain incredibly complicated theories in a way that is understandable to the average reader. In less than 300 pages Hawking covers topics like the nature of time and space, the origin of the universe, black holes, and time travel.

I&#8217;ve read the book twice, but like many people I suppose, I&#8217;ve also read parts of it from time to time and shared it with friends over the years. What I find fascinating is that I enjoy reading it even through the passages where I feel a little foggy. It&#8217;s brilliantly done and the illustrated edition includes dozens of wonderful images which make it a pleasure to pick up and review every once in a while &#8211; when you are in an intellectual or contemplative mood especially.
