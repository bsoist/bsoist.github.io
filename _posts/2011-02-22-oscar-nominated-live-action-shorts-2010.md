I thought this year&#8217;s batch of nominees were all very good.

## The Confession {#the_confession}

> It&#8217;s like nothing ever happened.

A chilling film which starts where many short films do but quickly turns on. This film explores the nature of childhood foolishness, faith, friendship, and religion. The young actors were fantastic and the directing and cinematography was excellent.

## Wish 143 {#wish_143}

> I smell Jesus.

A light-hearted look at a very real issue which many terminally ill young people must face. A comedy one minute and a drama the next. A surprisingly moving film.

## The Crush {#the_crush}

> I would&#8217;ve taken you for lunch.

The lead character is so adorable that you may ignore that he is a very misguided young man. His teacher&#8217;s behavior is bizarre and inappropriate too. I enjoyed the film but it was the most flawed of the films, in my opinion.

## Na WeWe {#na_wewe}

> It&#8217;s complicated, Sir.

A tense, thought provoking look at racism set in the Burundi during the horrible tribal violence that took place there and in Rwanda in the early 1990s. It makes you think carefully about the violence and senselessness, but some may walk away with the impression the violence in Burundi was not as bad as it really was.

## God of Love {#god_of_love}

> It was meant to be.

This movie was the only one of the five that was not very dark. A likable, lounge singing, darts master receives an answer to prayer.
