Like most of Kubrick&#8217;s films, [The Shining][1] is a masterpiece. The film is classic Kubrick &#8211; wide symetrical shots, vivid colors, contorted faces of our main characters &#8211; and I could watch it over and over again.

It is not very true to the original story but it is terrifying nonetheless. It is the story of Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes a job as the winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in order to focus on his writing. The book portrays a likable buy who is driven mad by the demons haunt the empty halls at the hotel. The movie, on the other hand, tells a story of a different man. Movie Jack is very unlikable from the beginning and appears to be at least half way to insane from the beginning. Jack Nicholson&#8217;s portrayal of this unlikable guy &#8211; that&#8217;s a stretch, huh? &#8211; is brilliant.

Shelley Duvall is wildly believable in her role. She does her best to be a sweet supportive wife to this nutcase though he frequently hurls insults and profanity at her. Meanwhile, their son Danny rides his big wheel around the hotel, chats with his imaginary friend Tony, and sees visions of death and destruction. Now that I think about it, the whole family is nuts before they head off on this &#8220;adventure.&#8221;

Danny&#8217;s big wheel rides provide some of the best shots in the film. Kubrick&#8217;s use of sound, parallel lines, and movement in these scenes is stunning. They also are a classic example of a technique he uses all the time &#8211; long shots from the character&#8217;s point of view. Another classic example of this is the chase scene near the end of the film.

The only shots that rival the riding scenes are those of Danny&#8217;s and Jack&#8217;s visions (if that is what they are). The two creepy little girls, the room filling with blood, and the ball room scenes are tremendous. And, of course, like every other Kubrick film we have a shot in the bathroom &#8211; and this one is about as freaky as they come.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen it &#8211; see it again.

P.S. This last viewing was with my son who had not yet seen it. I did not realize at the time that the HD version had been extended. I wish we&#8217;d seen the original first. I didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with the new scenes (and I&#8217;ve seen them before but didn&#8217;t realize the difference in versions until this time) but I&#8217;d like Billy to have seen the original first.
