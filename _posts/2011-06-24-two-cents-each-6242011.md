This week I&#8217;ve included several links as part of a bibliography to go with [two posts][1] I wrote earlier in the week. I&#8217;ve not included comments for them below.

[Alex Payne â€” How I Use TextMate][2]
:   TextMate is my second favorite editor &#8211; after vim of course <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8211; and I love the bundles.

[Disney Princesses, Deconstructed][3]
:   One of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.

[Lawmaker Says Most Want to Disband Ethics Office][4]
:   The commentary is the funnies part.

[The Complete Guide to Not Giving a F*ck][5]
:   A little heavy on the language for me but very, very true. Excellent advice &#8211; minus the profanity. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

[Whatâ€™s Wrong With American Television][6]
:   The author pinpoints exactly what is wrong with American television. The same thing that is ruining everything else about America &#8211; unmitigated capitalism.Â 

[Freakonomics Â» What Can Movie Stars Tell Us About Marriage And Education?][7]
:   So it's not why we think but we still don't know why?

[Weird software bugs][8]
:   Very funny list indeed!

[Why programmers are not paid in proportion to their productivity â€” The Endeavour][9]
:   &quot;Programmers are most effective when they avoid writing code.&quot;  
    >   
    > I could not agree more!

[Seth&#8217;s Blog: The $20,000 phone call][10]
:   The receptionists I deal with are all very nice, of course, but I never understood why most I've dealt with over the years are exactly as Seth describes. I don't get it.Â 

[Ranking Baseball&#8217;s Best Ballparks &#8211; NYTimes.com][11]
:   &quot;Iâ€™m working on an article about the New York Mets â€” but that subject is perhaps too depressing for a beautiful Memorial Day weekend.&quot;  
    >   
    > Could not agree more. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

[A VC: Enough Is Enough][12]
:   Enough is Enough &#8211; Absolutely!

[danwebb.net &#8211; It&#8217;s About The Hashbangs][13]
:   I haven't thought much about this but my gut reaction is that these things &quot;break&quot; the web. In general, I don't like them.</dl>
