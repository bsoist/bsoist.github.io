Yesterday was the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s [Letter from a Birmingham Jail][1]. I missed it, but as I&rsquo;ve written before ([2009][2], [2010][3], [2012][4]), Dr. King is one of my heroes, and this one action on his part &#8211; something he could have easily procrastinated or talked himself out of &#8211; has impacted the lives of millions and millions of us.

We need more people like him.&nbsp;
