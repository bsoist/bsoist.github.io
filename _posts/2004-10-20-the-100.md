One of my favorite books is titled *The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History*. It contains short pieces about the most influential persons from history, including an enlightening collection of &#8216;honorable mentions.&#8217;. It is a fascinating book. Recently, I added a similar book to my wishlist &#8212; The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written: The History of Thought from Ancient Times to Today. With all of this, I have never thought about putting a similar list together on my own. Then I read [this][3], and [this][4]. Well, really I did not read the lists. It dawned on me that I should work on a list. I will post the list when I finish it.
