I'm a long time fan of RSS feeds. I subscribe to hundreds of feeds. I've taken some time away from it several times to experiment with getting my "news" elsewhere, but I always come back to some kind of feed reader. After the latest break, I went back to poring through my feeds. One of the topic folders I have is called faith. When I started reading the feeds in this folder, I became sad. 
There were eleven feeds represented. Eight of these feeds are from what most people would call "Christian blogs" ( two are atheist and one is decidedly not typical ). 
There were twenty-two posts to read from those eight feeds. FIVE of them from four different feeds were about abortion and two of them were about homosexuality. I understand these are important, relevant, and timely issues. If the posts were well written essays on the issues at hand, I wouldn't even mind. What bothers me is that they are just more of the same rhetoric about the political issue and the signals of a culture in decline, etc. etc.
I just think almost 33% of the posts dedicated to political rhetoric is out of balance. There are a lot of things Christians &emdash; and people of other faiths or no faith &emdash; could discuss.
