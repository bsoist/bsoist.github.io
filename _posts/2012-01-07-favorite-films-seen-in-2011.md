As usual, some of them were not released in 2011. Unfortunately, I suspect I missed many of the best films of 2011 &#8211; even more than 2010 &#8211; so next year&#8217;s list will be whacked again. Links below are to my previous thoughts on the film (however brief they may have been).

My favorite 11 films of 2011 &#8230;

  * [Of Gods and Men (2010)][1]
  * [The Tree of Life (2011)][2]
  * [Flipped (2010)][3]
  * [Source Code (2011)][4]
  * The Muppets (2011)
  * [Black Swan (2010)][3]
  * [Winter&#8217;s Bone (2010)][3]
  * Hotel Rwanda (2004)
  * The Stoning of Sonya M (2008)
  * [Inside Job (2010)][3]
  * [Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)][2]
