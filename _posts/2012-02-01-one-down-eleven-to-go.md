New Year&#8217;s Day is not just the first day of the year, it&#8217;s my birthday, so it&#8217;s a great time to reflect on my life and my goals. But I don&#8217;t do &#8220;official&#8221; resolutions. Long term goals are one thing, but a year long committment to a new and better habit seems counterproductive to me. When I do make promises to myself, and I fall short, I do what I think most people do. I start over at a later date. Hitching my self improvement habits to the first of the year makes it too tempting to start over at the beginning of the next year &#8211; even when I give up on a habit in February.

This is why I love the idea of [12 in 12][1]. It wasn&#8217;t my idea, and I&#8217;ve seen veriatios on the theme before, but when I read about it in early January I decided [it was for me][2]. It just makes more sense to me to shorten the cycle. 

Before I get to my progress report for January, I have to confess. I broke the rules a bit &#8211; as I plan to do in February. I&#8217;ve been working on several habits over the last 14 months or so and I wanted to use the new year as a way to get my act together. I decided I would take those goals and wrap them up in routines I could do in January and February. 

I promise to play by the rules starting in March.

January was about my morning routine. I like to get up at four a.m, read my Bible, catch up on my reading, get some writing done, and get to work. I&#8217;ve been following this routine &#8220;on and off&#8221; for a couple of years, but the problem is that when I get off the routine, I really get off track. 

Keeping in the spirit of 12 in 12, I decided the goal for January was to finish my daily reading before 6a.m. I was able to do on all but three of the days in January. As expected, the rest of the routine pretty much fell in line.

I&#8217;ll fill you in on February&#8217;s mission next month. I&#8217;ll give you a hint &#8211; I had a very delicious BBG burger last night for dinner and chased it down with some peanut butter cups. 

Try it for yourself in February, and follow along with other [12ers][3] on Twitter.
