The Minnesota Atheists and a United Methodist church in Minnesota are teaming up to sponsor a [secular bible study][1]. The study will focus on the will focus on the the Bible&#8217;s historical and cultural context and aims to &#8220;foster and nurture relationships between folks who would otherwise avoid each other,&#8221; according to Chester O&#8217;Gorman, community outreach director for the church.

O&#8217;Gorman says:

> We&#8217;ve discerned that people have lost or lack the skills to engage in constructive and respectful dialogue in the context of profound disagreement, 

I am a theist &#8211; no question about it &#8211; but I have many atheist friends and acquaintances. I think this gives me a well-rounded perspective on things. I may vehemently disagree with the conclusion they draw but by engaging in sensible discourse, I learn to spot fallible arguments on &#8220;my side&#8221; of the debate. More importantly, I learn to respect other human beings and their opinions.

I wish more people would take this approach in other areas. Our culture emphasizes exclusionary thinking and I think that&#8217;s a shame. One debate where this comes to mind is the abortion debate. I am pro-choice but I have many, many friends who would love nothing better than for Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Many of them don&#8217;t take advantage of opportunities to actually solve the problem. People on both sides of the debate may have a lot they can agree on. Why can we not get together in the spirit of this Bible study to help solve a real problem?
