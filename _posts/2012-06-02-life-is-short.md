The first film on my list this week features the phrase &#8220;life is brief.&#8221; The phrase is uttered several times in word and song throughout the film. I mention it for two reasons. One, because it&#8217;s true &#8211; life is very brief indeed. Second, because it reminds me of our trip to Italy.

We were in Florence, the city I had always wanted to see. While I certainly did enjoy the art and all the things I&#8217;ve always wanted to see, the rest of the experience was much more &#8220;touristy&#8221; than the rest of the trip (and more than we enjoy). It was also where we ate the only meal we didn&#8217;t really like. In response to my complaints, the manger of the restaurant kept using the phrase &#8220;life is short, leave it!&#8221;

and now for this week&#8217;s movies &#8230;

> I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve been doing with my life all these years.

A masterpiece film that addresses the question of living without really living. A brilliant film I could watch again today.

> You can go to places in the world with pudding.

A bewildering cacophony of colors, light, and unexpected events. Excellent performances by Adam Sandler, Emily Watson, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Very well done.

> The thing that people love about Elmo, is he needs them.

A fascinating story about the puppeteer who is Elmo. A must-see film.

> Weâ€™re not lost, weâ€™re just finding our way.

An excellent film depicting the journey of a small group of families headed West to claim their fortune. Certainly the most realistic take on this I&#8217;ve ever seen.
