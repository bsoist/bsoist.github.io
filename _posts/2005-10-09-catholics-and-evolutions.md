I am very tired of the evolution/creation debate for a lot of reasons, but here is quick glimpse at my real problem. [This post][1] was written in reaction to [this post][2]. I have read both of these posts and I cannot help think that the authors actually agree. You should read both posts and see for yourself, but the following quotes illustrate what I mean.  

> &#8220;Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense &#8212; an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection &#8212; is not. Any system of thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for design in biology is ideology, not science.&#8221;<cite><a href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/catholic/schonborn-NYTimes.html">Finding Design in Nature</a> by Christoph Schonborn July 7, 2005</cite>

> &#8220;The theory of evolution can be disturbing to Christians because it seems to clash with the idea of divine creation,&#8221; said Nicola Cabibbo, president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a 78-member body of academics who advise the pope on scientific matters. Cabibbo is a professor of particle physics at RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s La Sapienza University.&#8221;However, this clash is false. What clashes with divine creation is an extension of the theory of evolution into materialistic interpretations, so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“evolutionism,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ &#8221; Cabbibo told NCR July 18. &#8220;ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not science, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metaphysics.&#8221;<cite><a href="http://www.ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005c/072905/072905h.php">Catholic experts urge caution in evolution debate</a> by John L. Allen Jr.</cite>
