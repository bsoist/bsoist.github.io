A couple of months ago, my "rank" among LinkedIn connections caught my attention. Now before I lose you, I should mention that this is not going to be a post about how to increase your rank or about a better algorithm for calculating rank, etc. I have no interest in either.

When I first noticed that my rank was in the bottom 25%, my ego kicked in. How was this possible that I ranked that low? I quickly realized, however, that this is really what I want.

Over the years I've advised a few clients who just didn't "get" LinkedIn. They didn't see any value in it for anyone aside from the "look who I know" ego factor. It took me a little while to get past that too. I certainly don't get as much value out of LinkedIn as I could, but I think there is potential to use it as a very important networking tool.

I didn't look into what the rank means, but the context implies that my connections draw more attention to their profiles and their work than I do. If that's the case, then I really want my connections to "outrank" me, don't I? I want connections with more experience and "better" connections than I. I want connctions from whom I can learn, and connections who can introduce me to even more connections who are "more connected" than I.

Or, maybe I don't get how to use LinkedIn at all. That wouldn't surprise me.
