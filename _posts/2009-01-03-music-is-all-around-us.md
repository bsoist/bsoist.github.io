All we have to do is listen.

*August Rush*Â is a modern fairy tale which I almost missed. I added it to my Netflix queue after hearing about it and quickly forgot about it. Later, I moved all the Blu-Ray movies to the top of my queue paying little attention paid to the movies. When this movie arrived I&#8217;d forgotten why I put in on my queue in the first place and the description didin&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; so I almost sent it back.Â 

Wow, am I glad we decided to watch it as a family. What a wonderful story!Â 

Music has always played an important role in my life and this film reminded me of that as well as the mystery of life&#8217;s connections. If you don&#8217;t understand how music has an impact on life, don&#8217;t see this movie. Everyone else &#8211; you should see this movie as soon as you can.
