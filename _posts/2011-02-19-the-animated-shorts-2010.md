Every year we go as a family to see the Oscar nominated animated short films. Last Saturday we saw the animated films. I didn&rsquo;t think this year&rsquo;s crop was as good as previous years but I enjoyed all of them and thought I&#8217;d share a few thoughts.

## Day & Night

A fun look at the friendship between nighttime and daytime. I&#8217;ve seen it three times and I chuckle every time but it doesn&rsquo;t do much more for me than that.

## The Lost Thing

This is place where things go to be forgotten.  
A short film with outstanding art and a powerful message. This was my favorite of the films.

## The Gruffalo

> &hellip;and the nut was good.

A fable telling the story of a mouse who outwits three predators while on his quest to find a nut. A little longer than it needed to be, in my opinion.

## Madagascar, Carnet de Voyage

An impressionistic travel journal of a tourists adventures in Madagascar and the favorite to win. The use of different types of visuals was brilliant but the lack of story is this film&rsquo;s real drawback.

## Letâ€™s Pollute

> Want it, waste it!

A fun educational film spoof promoting the benefits of consumer excess.

This year the [theater][1] is showing the animated and live actions on two separate weekends. I&#8217;ll post my thoughts on the live actions later &ndash; probably Monday.
