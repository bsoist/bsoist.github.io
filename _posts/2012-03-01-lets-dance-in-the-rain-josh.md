I&#8217;ve decided on my first Kickstarter project for March.

It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s book entitledÂ ***[Let&#8217;s Dance in the Rain Josh][1]*** about how we come up with excuse after excuse not to live life.

It&#8217;s like I always say &#8211; excuses are like armpits, everyone&#8217;s got two of them and they all stink!

See the rest of the projects I am backing this month [over here][2]Â and my backing history [over here][3].
