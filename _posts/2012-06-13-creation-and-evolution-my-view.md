About a month ago, [I decided][1] to start a regular post on the topic of science and religion, and I thought it made sense to start with a series about creation and evolution. 

I know that sharing my opinions at this stage might take away from an objective review of the issues as we move forward, but I also think that some might benefit from knowing where I stand on the issues right up front. 

As I think I [have made clear already][2], my opinion on these matter may change over time, but as of this moment, this is what I believe &#8230;

  * I believe in God, because I do. I don&#8217;t think the evidence for His existence is sufficient to believe. I simply believe.
  * I believe the [Scriptures are inspired by God Himself][3].
  * I believe [nature is also God&#8217;s revelation][2].
  * I believe God created the universe approximately 14 billion years ago.
  * I believe the events described in Genesis 1:2 immediately followed the events described in Genesis 1:1.
  * I believe in the Big Bang &#8211; the universe started in an extremely hot and dense state, some 14 billion years ago, and that it has been expanding ever since. 
  * I believe that the days of creation are chronological.
  * I believe that the durations of each day are not necessarily equal, and that they represent very long periods of time (millions and millions of years).
  * I believe that galaxies and solar systems formed over billions of years. I accept astronomical evolution. 
  * I believe the current geology of the Earth is a result of billions of years of geological evolution.
  * I believe the Earth was seeded with life intentionally by God. He may have chosen to do so via fiat, or chemical evolution may have played a part. I have no idea.
  * I believe [atheism is not a prerequisite to believing in evolution][4]
  * I believe there is overwhelming evidence for biological evolution.
  * I operate under the assumption that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor.
  * I think the fossil record supports either special creation by God at different times during the history of Earth, or in some kind of non-Darwinian evolution from one species to another.

I think those last three points deserves some explanation. I have no philosophical or theological bias against biological evidence. As a matter of fact, I agree with Charles Darwin&#8217;s view of this idea.

> There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.

My area of interest is cosmology, astrophysics, and theology. I have read extensively on the theory of biological evolution, but mostly from a philosophical standpoint. I simply do not have the expertise in biology to make an informed decision. I have also studied Scripture for many years, but I don&#8217;t know enough to say for sure whether I think God uses biological evolution as a means for creation. I would have no problem with it if He did, I just simply don&#8217;t know.

Labels

For those of you who would prefer I label myself in terms of the current debate &#8230;

  * I reject the supposed physical evidence of a young earth as pseudoscience. 
  * I think organizations like Answers in Genesis and the Institute for Creation Research spread misinformation and lies.
  * I reject &#8220;flood geology&#8221; as pseudoscience.
  * I think &#8220;Creation Science&#8221; is not science at all.
  * I think [intelligent design is not science][5].
  * I subscribe to some kind of old earth creationism &#8211; probably progressive creationism, but I don&#8217;t rule out theistic evolution (in fact, as mentioned above, I rather like the idea)
  * I reject the gap theory and hold to a &#8220;day age&#8221; view of Genesis chapter one, though I have no theological opposition to suggestions that the days of creation represent days of revelation instead of the actual days of creation.
