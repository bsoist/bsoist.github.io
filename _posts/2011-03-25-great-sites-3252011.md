I am going to change the name of this periodic feature. I&#8217;ve noticed that some sites I link to aren&#8217;t quite **great**. I&#8217;m going to call it *Interesting Sites* or something similar. 

Anyway, I thought I&#8217;d throw in a few sites today that I&#8217;ve been using so long that I forget others may not know how great they are.

  * Escape The City &#8211; [link][1] 
  * If You Watch it Backwards &#8211; [link][2] 
  * Today I Found Out &#8211; [link][3] 
  * useit.com: Jakob Nielsen on Usability and Web Design &#8211; [link][4] 
  * Creative Commons &#8211; [link][5] 
  * The GNU Operating System &#8211; [link][6]
