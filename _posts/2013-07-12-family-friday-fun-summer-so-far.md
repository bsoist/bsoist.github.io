We&#8217;re having a fun summer.

Becky is playing summer league field hockey, but I&#8217;m not really going to talk about how things are going until it&#8217;s over. I&#8217;ll give you an update in a couple weeks. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Billy was home for several weeks and we had the opportunity to spend time together &#8211; played a lot of board games and watched a lot of movies. As a matter of fact, my Fathers Day gifts this year reflected our family&#8217;s interest in both games and movies.

Becky gave me a great new game called [Forbidden Island][1]<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=weifyoasme-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B003D7F4YY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. We learned of the game on a recent visit to [Marbles][2], and we both knew we would like it. It turned out to be one of our favorite games as a family. It&#8217;s a lot of fun. If you enjoy cooperative board games, you should check this one out.

Billy gave me cash to apply toward [Movie Pass][3], which is a great service that allows me to pay a monthly fee for the privilege of seeing one movie per day ( as long as I don&#8217;t use it for the same movie more than once). It&#8217;s a great service. I&#8217;ve seen seven movies in fifteen days, so I&#8217;m enjoying it so far. Actually, I&#8217;ve seen thirteen, but seven in the theater.

Fair warning to those of you who subscribe to my movie reviews. I may kick it up a notch and review more than one a week.

If you don&#8217;t currently subscribe, you may want to. I will be reviewing more movies that are in theaters now than I used to. Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be sharing a brief review of each of the films I&#8217;ve seen with Movie Pass so far.

AND I&#8217;m planning a brief review of the entire Fast & Furious franchise for next Saturday.

You can subscribe to my reviews separately, or if you currently subscribe to &#8220;almost everything,&#8221; you can replace that with everything. Visit [this page][4] for more information.
