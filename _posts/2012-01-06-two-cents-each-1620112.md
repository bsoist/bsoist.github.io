[Political Animal &#8211; The worst possible idea at the worst possible time][1]
:   I could not agree more -Â balancingÂ the budget right now is one of the worst ideas at precisely the wrong time.

[Class Warfare My Ass || kuro5hin.org][2]
:   Excellent post! Who is waging the war, really?

[Maybe stick to novels, dear. â€“ Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report][3]
:   I couldn't agree more &#8211; about the books and the website.

[Alex Jones is not our ally and not our friend Â« theConverted][4]
:   &#34;Jones is, to put it bluntly, a paranoid conspiracy theorist whose grasp on reality surely needs to be questioned.&#34;Exactly!

[Wall Street and Silicon Valley Â« The Baseline Scenario][5]
:   An excellent rebuttal to the claim that &#34;without Wall Street we would not have had Silicon Valley.&#34;

[Occupy Wall Street: The Most Important Thing in the World Now | The Nation][6]
:   The most important thing in the world now. Agreed.

[Dear GoDaddy, itâ€™s not just SOPA, itâ€™s you | Joris Van den Broeck][7]
:   &#34;Itâ€™s like that wrong girl you meet in the club, you know you shouldnâ€™t go home with her but you still do if she tries hard enough.&#34;EXACTLY!!

[The Bait and Switch of Contemporary Christianity | Richard Beck | God's Politics Blog | Sojourners: Celebrating 40 Years of Faith in Action for Social Justice][8]
:   Wow, what a great way to describe what has been going on. Many people, it seems to me, use faith as an excuse.

[IP Feudalism and the Shrinking of the Public Domain][9]
:   &#34;and it could be well into the 22nd century before we get Star Wars prequels worthy of the name.&#34;

:   &#34;Your children, they ruin everything in the nicest way.&#34;Exactly!

[Santorum wants to impose 'Judeo-Christian Sharia' &#8211; CNN.com][11]
:   People don't get it. A government built on religion &#8211; even the correct one &#8211; is a bad idea for so many reasons.  
    First, who decides which one?

[America Beyond Capitalism: Is It Possible? | | AlterNet][12]
:   Some might scream SOCIALISM! To which, I respond &#34;So?&#34;Socialism is not necessarily the same thing as big government.
