Every time I hear a great cover song, I think about putting a list together of my favorites. After months of thinking about it, I&#8217;ve finally done it. 

Before we get to the list, though, I&#8217;ll explain my criteria for selection.

  1. I like the original version of the song.
  2. I like the cover version at least as much as than the original.
  3. The cover version is sufficiently different.
  4. Both versions were recorded (not simply performed live).
  5. The cover was released at least one year after the original.

In order to account for natural biases for and against certain artists I arbitrarily decided that the same artist will not show up more than once in the list. 

I did NOT consider the popularity of the cover compared to the original. There are many examples of covers being more popular than the original but I did not include or exclude songs on that basis.

## Now the list &#8230; {#now_the_list_8230}

I narrowed it down to my favorite fifteen. They are listed below in alphabetical order. I&#8217;ve also created a playlist at Rhapsody [over here][1].
