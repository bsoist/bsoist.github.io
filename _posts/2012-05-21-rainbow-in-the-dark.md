*Rainbow in the Dark* was the second single released by one of the greatest metal bands of all time &#8211; Dio &#8211; and is considered by many to be one of the greatest metal anthems of all time.

There is considerable debate about the meaning ( and quality ) of the lyrics, but very few question the song&#8217;s place in metal history. Even fewer question Ronnie James Dio&#8217;s status as one of the best frontmen in the history of heavy metal. Whenever we hear him at our house, someone always chimes in with &#8220;second greatest rock and roll singer of all time&#8221; ( second to Freddie Mercury ).

There are fans who believe the song is a &#8220;gay anthem&#8221; about a closet homosexual, perhaps Dio himself, perhaps a friend (Rob Halford). I think that interpretation is forced. In a 2005 interview with VH1, Ronnie James Dio stated that the lyrics were based on his feeling of isolation after having left Black Sabbath. I am not alone in thinking that the lyrics better fit the relationship Dio had with another former band &#8211; Rainbow.



<pre>When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found

I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the mornin' comin'
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons
Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?

You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the mornin' comin'
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
Yeah

When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found

Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out

There's no sight of the mornin' comin'
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah, yeah

You're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the mornin'
You're a rainbow in the dark
</pre>
