After watching two of my favorite Sunday morning talk shows I am astounded at what I heard about bias in the media.

> &#8230;the degree to which, **especially ABC and CBS**&#8230; don&#8217;t ever meet anyone who fundamentally disagrees with them and that that colors their entire reporting really can&#8217;t be underestimated.<cite>Bill Kristol on Fox News Sunday</cite>

> Desire, **especially at NBC**, to make sure that we are as objective as possible, the facts are clear, and there is less commentary<cite>Norah O&#8217;Donnell on The Chris Matthews Show</cite>

> They were kinda liberal actually. In addition to that they were arrogant and they were unwilling to admit that they were devaluing their own credibility with their biases.<cite>Tucker Carlson on The Chris Matthews Show</cite>

Bill Kristol went on to say that he has always thought that calling the media biased is usually an excuse for conservative failure. I could not agree more, **but, ** I do think all reporters let bias slip into reports.Â It should be noted that the quote from Ms. O&#8217;Donnell is here &#8216;out of context.&#8217; Her point was that broadcast news is really less biased than cable (or Internet) news.**No arguments from me.**
