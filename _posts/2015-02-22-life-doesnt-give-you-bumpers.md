It's no secret we're huge movies fan at our house. Every year, we try to see all of the nominated films before the Oscars. Some years, we have just a few to see. Other years, like this one, we have to really scramble to see them all.

This year I saw 19 of the 50 which represents 56.2% of the nominations. I usually do a little better, but that's not bad.

My predictions - in order based on categories I care most about and am more qualified to judge.
