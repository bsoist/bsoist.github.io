This month&#8217;s [12er challenge][1] was to write 750 words a day at [750words.com][2]. I&#8217;d seen the site a while back and never tried using it. I write almost every day and over the course of the day I certainly compose more than 750 words, but I&#8217;ve never tried to adopt the practice of &#8220;morning pages.&#8221; So, I decided to do it as April&#8217;s [12er][1] &#8211; and I enjoyed it very much.

April was the best [12er][1] month yet. Not in terms of my commitment. That honor goes to January. To date, I have stuck to my January goal every day except for February 1st. In April, I missed four days. I&#8217;m not sure, but I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a substantial amount every single day and for the first 25 days of April, I did that &#8211; and now I know I can do it every day. 

It was very valuable long term. About halfway through the month, I wrote this as part of my entry for the day.

> I&#8217;m finding this 750 words thing very valuable. I am not sure how happy I am with the exporting of ideas thing, but I like the exercise of writing[<sup>*</sup>][3]. I have found, though, that I find myself looking for ways to pad my writing, which is the exact opposite of the way I&#8217;ve always learned to write. On the one hand, I love the &#8221; just write it down and think about it later approach &#8221; ( I&#8217;ve always tried to write like that anyway ) . On the other, I find myself writing more &#8221; on purpose &#8221; which is , I think , a very bad habit. I also find myself thinking of ways to cheat too much &#8211; like surrounding punctuation marks , with spaces so they count as a word . ( see how I am doing it here ) . <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> and that is another trick &#8211; not using contractions. I tend to use contractions when they are natural, but I think I normally use fewer than most writers ( I do not know , how would I know ), but I find myself deciding not to use them here because they only count as one word ( unless of course , I add spaces <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8211; then they count as three . <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Seems like a lot of smiley in there, but they counted as one word each. 

It was a great month. I loved every minute of it &#8211; except for Friday morning when I woke up and realized I had not written on Thursday. I was so disappointed I missed the next three days. 

In addition to the positive of keeping up with the [12er][1], there is a lot about the website I really like. I signed up for the monthly challenge in April, so now my name is on the [Wall of Shame][4] until I successfully do a whole month. I&#8217;m not sure that motivates anyone else, but it does me.

I also love the badges. They are interesting enough to have got my attention. I plan to earn all of them.

Actually, I am so keen on getting some of the badges that it almost caused a fight with my wife. She called one day just as I had started the writing. It was incredibly frustrating because I was not going for the before 9a.m. badge so I could have written any time. As a matter of fact , I had thought about it a couple of times, and then decided against it. Then I started &#8211; and she called. Long story &#8211; but she understood what I was trying to do. No big deal , crisis averted , writing done &#8211; no distractions ( or none longer than 3 minutes anyway <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ).

Finally, I thoroughly enjoy the emphasis on stats and metadata. The site analyzes your use of words, mood, etc. It&#8217;s a real blast. Highly recommended.

I did write this post yesterday, but I used [750words.com][2] to write the first draft &#8211; so it&#8217;s not cheating. Is it?

<p style="font-size:0.8em;">
  *&nbsp;I use the sites export feature at the end of the month to save my writing. I also had planned to export every Monday and peruse the last week&#8217;s entries for ideas for my blog. This sentence was me wondering out loud if I liked that idea. In the end I did not. I&#8217;ve already found a more efficient way to harness the ideas.
