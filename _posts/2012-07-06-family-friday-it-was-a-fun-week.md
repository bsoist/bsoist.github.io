Becky and I finally found some time to play Guitar Hero together on Sunday. We rocked through about a dozen tunes. That was awesome. Becky actually had a pleasant surprise for me on our way to NYC on Tuesday. She told me she finally decided which instrument to learn &#8211; the guitar. I&#8217;m not sure if our Guitar Hero session had much to do with it, but I was very pleased. I plan to teach her a few things to get her started and then we&#8217;ll find her a real teacher. <img src='http://archive.whsjr.soistmann.com/oped/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

We ended the day with two viewings of Primer. I&#8217;ve [seen it many times][1], but Becky had only seen if four times so she had been asking to see it again sometime. We watched it once, then Becky studied a couple of proposed timelines for the film, and then we watched it again and discussed each scene as we went along. We plan to watch the commentaries next. I&#8217;ve seen them, but it&#8217;s fun watching again with her.

Tuesday we travelled to JFK to pick up Billy and then went straight to Citi Field to see the Mets beat up on the Sillies. Then we stayed for the fireworks and a celebration of 50 years of Mets.

On Independence Day we decided to stay home and grill and watch the fireworks on TV since we had seen some the night before. We always go somewhere to see them, including DC twice ([2009][2] & [2011][3]), so this was going to be a nice change. We had the grill going all day, watched Cliff Lee get his first win of the season against the Mets, and caught a few eps of Lost. Becky made an excellent holiday strawberry shortcake.

Yesterday I had to get back to work, but Billy and I are starting a new project together so we spent several hours together planning. Then Becky and I put together the stationary bike which arrived via UPS yesterday. Last night Billy and I finally went to see Prometheus. Since he was in Germany when it debuted, this was really our first opportunity to see it together. I&#8217;ll write more about the movie tomorrow.

In the middle of it all, I was able to get quite a bit of work done too. It was my kind of week.
