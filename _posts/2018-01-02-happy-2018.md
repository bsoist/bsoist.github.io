I am looking forward to the new year.

This time of year is always the same for me. After Christmas, which I enjoy very much, I always begin to look forward to the new year. January 1 is my birthday, so that brings an added layer of excitment, but it also comes with all of the other complicated feelings one has on a birthday.

It's the same for me every year. Excitement and anticipation before the new year, more excitment, now mixed with anxiety when the new year actually begins.

Some great things happened in 2017. Becky had a great final season on the mock trial team, and made the state tournament for discus in May. She was also accepted into some great schools, including UCLA where she decided to attend. It's a beautiful place in a beautiful place and we are thrilled she has the opportunity to study there. We are very proud of her.

Aside from those highlights, and perhaps a lot of smaller things I don't remember now, 2017 was not a banner year. In fact, it was a very hard one.

Terri and I are pleased to move on to 2018.

We are looking forward to new things.
