> No drums! No drums! Jack Black said no drums! 

This movie was nothing but a good time. It had all the same goofiness and silly self-awareness of the muppets TV show. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I felt so good after a film.

> Oh, drugs are so bad! 

Not a big fan of alien movies, but this was a blast. I&#8217;m a film lover myself and I would have been just about the same age as the main characters in the film, so it was a nostalgic ride.

> Rather than helping people with horse problems, I&#8217;m helping horses with people problems. 

A moving story about how one man turned his own personal tragedy into a passion to help people and horses. A must see documentary for anyone who loves animals or personal stories.

> You mean, like a doctor? 

Much better than I expected. A story about human nature supported by the immanent threat of danger. Thoroughly enjoyable.

> What do you fear? 

It simply felt right to watch something put together by people all over the world. Some of the scenery was fantastic, and it was a blast to connect with people at that level. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t like some of the realism &#8211; people on toilets, animals slaughtered, surgeries, etc.

> Everything is a test! 

I enjoyed watching this, but that&#8217;s the only positive thing I can say. Forgettable and predictable.
