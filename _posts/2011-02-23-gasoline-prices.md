Anytime someone complains about the rising cost of gasoline, two things come to mind.

## I donâ€™t think it is rising {#i_don8217t_think_it_is_rising}

I was in sixth grade during the â€œenergy crisisâ€ and I vividly remember waiting in line for gasoline on even or odd days only. I remember the panic that our planet might be running out of oil. I remember gasoline reaching more than a dollar a gallon and Iâ€™ve always thought to myself &#8211; â€œthat was a lot of money in 1979!â€ In my head Iâ€™ve always assumed that was several of todayâ€™s dollars.

Today I decided to finally take a real look at the prices.

According to the [U.S. Energy Information Administration][1], retail gasoline prices rose steadily in 1979 from $0.72 to $1.07 per gallon &#8211; $2.31 to $3.07 in 2011 dollars ([source &#8211; XLS][2]). The Bureau of Labor Statistics [calculator][3] converts these prices to $2.18 &#8211; $3.25 per gallon.

Yesterday I paid $3.18 per gallon &#8211; right in the range between $3.07 and $3.25. It appears to me that prices have remained flat over the last 30+ years.

I thought it would be fun to look at a graph of the prices. I found this one

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1447" title="gas1" src="http://media.soistmann.com/oped/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/gas1-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />][4]

and the one from the DOE spreadsheet ([source &#8211; XLS)][2]

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1448" title="gas2" src="http://media.soistmann.com/oped/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/gas2-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="161" />

Both show the same two things:

  1. Prices are flat over the 32 year period.
  2. Prices actually dropped over a 20 year span.

NOTE: The first chart is based on data that is not quite the same as the DOE data, but close<sup><a href="#close">1</a></sup>.

## If it is rising, itâ€™s about time. {#if_it_is_rising_it8217s_about_time}

I know it is easy to say this when I can afford gasoline. I hope Iâ€™m never in a position where I canâ€™t afford it.

Prices in other countries have been high for years. I understand that other governments may place higher taxes on fuel to curb use but Iâ€™m convinced that prices have stayed low because the U.S. government does everything in its power to keep us dependent on oil.

<span sytle="font-size:0.8em;">I took all 1979 prices from <a href="http://www.randomuseless.info/gasprice/gasprice.html">http://www.randomuseless.info/gasprice/gasprice.txt</a> and saved them to my computer with the name gas.csv. Then I wrote a <a href="http://media.soistmann.com/oped/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/gas.py.txt" class="s3-link">quick little script</a> to figure the low, median, maximum, and average retail price. The figures I got &#8211; 0.7488 0.9615 1.281 0.94275443038 &#8211; did not match the figures from DOE but they were close.</span>
