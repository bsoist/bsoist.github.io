:   Scrabble is a great game and should be left alone. 

<a href="http://www.livescience.com/technology/090325-computer-prayer.html" tags="religion,faith">You Pay, Computer Prays For You | LiveScience</a>
:   "Information Age Prayer is a site that charges you a monthly fee to say prayers for you. A typical charge is $4.95 per month to say three prayers specified by you each day." Now I have seen everything. 

<a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-04/st_flowchart" tags="humor,media,funny,internet,culture,flowchart">Ask a Flowchart: Which Blowhard Am I?</a>
:   I am try again. I get to "You were blogging before electricity" and choose no so I end up at "Try Again." I started blogging in 1999 when I could barely afford to pay my electric bill &#8211; does that count?

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice" tags="business,blogging,writing,inspiration,obsession,motivation,daringfireball">Daring Fireball: Obsession Times Voice</a>
:   Very well said. Success comes from obsession &#8211; not with the money but with the work. If you care about your craft/product/service/whatever you will will stand a much better chance of success than if you care only about the reward. 

<a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/165113.asp" tags="apple,microsoft,windows,mac,advertising">Microsoft's new ad campaign goes recessionista chic</a>
:   This ad proves nothing. If someone gave me the offer &#8211; find a computer in this price range and you can keep it &#8211; I would do it. Microsoft is saying "PCs are cheap." Doesn't everyone know that already? I really don't see the point.

<a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/03/when-netflix-recommendations-go-wrong.html" tags="movies,netflix">Hacking NetFlix : When Netflix Recommendations Go Wrong</a>
:   "seems to indicate that fans of the despair and violence of The Wire and the lacerating misanthropy of Curb Your Enthusiasm will also enjoy an animated show for 3-year-olds"</p> 
    
    Sounds about right to me. </dd> 
    
    <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-confirms-paid-pro-accounts-on-the-way-2009-3" tags="twitter,business,socialmedia">Twitter Confirms Paid Pro Accounts On The Way</a>
    :   I pay a fee to use the premium versions of several web based services &#8211; Evernote, Flickr, Remember the Milk, and others. I would gladly pay extra for a few nice features if I needed them. 
    
    <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5179566/gcalcron-automates-your-linux-system-with-google-calendar" tags="google,calendar,linux,cron,lifehacker">Downloads: gCalCron Automates Your Linux System with Google Calendar</a>
    :   Nice little hack if you want to run cron jobs and don't remember the syntax or don't want to shell in. Note that there is a certain level of risk involved as noted in the post. 
    
    <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternative-uses-for-your-gmail-inbox/" tags="howto,gtd,gmail,organization">4 Alternative Uses For Your Gmail Inbox | MakeUseOf.com</a>
    :   A few nice tips you may or may not have thought of. 
    
    <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/090323-office-cardboard.html" tags="eco,economy,zero,environment,design">Office Built Entirely of Cardboard | LiveScience</a>
    :   Finding alternative uses for cardboard is important during our current economic climate, where the demand and price for recycled cardboard has dropped more than any other consumer product. 
    
    <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12540" tags="photos,photography,cs,flickr,creativecommons">Celebrate 100 Million CC Photos on Flickr with Joi Itoâ€™s Free Souls &#8211; Creative Commons</a>
    :   Flickrâ€™s integration of CC licenses was one of the first and best; not only do they allow users to specify licenses per-photo, but they offer an incredible CC discovery page which breaks down searches for CC licensed materials by license. This means that you can look for all the photos of New York City licensed under Attribution and sorted by interestingness, to give an example. 
    
    <a href="http://searchengineland.com/how-to-avoid-the-link-vacuum-effect-16946" tags="social,media">How To Avoid The Link Vacuum Effect</a>
    :   "But Twitter is becoming a kind of fishbowl where people merely link to a site from their Twitter account, not from their personal site."</p> 
        
        Umm, so? Perhaps we can get back to the day when content is more important than who links to you? </dd>
