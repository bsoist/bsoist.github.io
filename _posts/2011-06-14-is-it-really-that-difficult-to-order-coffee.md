It seems that every few weeks someone I know comments on the confusing process of ordering a drink at Starbucks or some other cafe. This never ceases to amuse me. 

Is it really that difficult to order a drink? I don&#8217;t think it is. Presumably, you wandered in looking for coffee. Well, guess what? They sell coffee. Order one. 

Yes, they have other options, but isn&#8217;t it just like any other restaurant? Look at the menu, ask a question or two, order something. If you like it, you&#8217;ll have learned one thing you can order next time. If not, try again.

If you are really bothered by the elitists behind you who snub their noses at you because you don&#8217;t know what you want, then do a little research. Come up with something you&#8217;d like to try, walk in, pretend you know what you are doing, and order it. If you like it, &#8230; You get the idea.

For those of you that want a little help, you could try this little [order helper][1] I started to put together. I&#8217;d love some feedback on what I missed.
