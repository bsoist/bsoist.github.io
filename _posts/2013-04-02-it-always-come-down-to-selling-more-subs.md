I had a revelation about myself yesterday. I&#8217;ve seen it coming for months, but yesterday it hit me like a ton of bricks.

I&#8217;m not quite ready to share every detail, but I saw three posts in my RSS feed today that confirmed I was on the right track. 

[The Curse of Tomorrow][1]

[The loneliness epidemic][2]

[The mistakes only get bigger][3]

These three posts inspired me today, confirmed yesterday&#8217;s revelation, and reminded me of something my dad and I always used to say.

We were in business together for quite some time, and all of our strategy meetings would always end up in the same place &#8211; we just needed to sell more subs.
